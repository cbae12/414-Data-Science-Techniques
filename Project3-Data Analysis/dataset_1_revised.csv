It's Only A Paper Moon,Frank Sinatra,1950,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/franksinatra/itsonlyapapermoon.html,"It is only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hangin' over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make believe
If you believed in me

Be Honest With Me(1991 CD Reissue),"Martin, Dean",1955,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deanmartin/behonestwithme.html,"Be honest with me dear whatever you do
Remember you're mine dear so always be true
Where ever you wander on land or on sea
If you really love me be honest with me

My poor heart would break dear if you were untrue
Asleep or awake dear I dream about you
Oh you are my darling you're all that I see
If you really love me be honest with me

Some day I'll return dear kinda make you my own
And how I will yearn dear when I'm all alone
But I never forget dear your sweet memory
If you really love me be honest with me

I'm Yours,Eddy Arnold,1957,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eddyarnold/imyours.html,"Ask the sky above and ask the earth below
Why I'm so in love and why I love you so
Couldn't tell you though I tried dear just why did I'm yours
When you went away you left a glowing spark
Trying to be gay as whistling in the dark
I am only what you make me come take me I'm yours

How happy I would be to beg and borrow a sorrow with you
Even though I knew tomorrow you'd say we were through
If we'd drift apart then I'll be lost alone
Though you use my heart just for a stepping stone
How can I help dreaming of you I love you I'm yours

Blues In My Heart,"Reeves, Jim",1957,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jimreeves/bluesinmyheart.html,"(Wish I could lose these blues in my heart)

Blues in my heart, oh, how it aches
Nobody knows the sorrow it takes
I should have known right from the start
You'd leave me with these blues in my heart.

(Gone is the love I couldn't hold)
(Feel like a lamb that's strayed from the fold)
What can I do, what can I say?
Blues in my heart have got me this way.

Rain's falling down, down from the sky
Why even the sun's beginning to cry
Everything's wrong since we're apart
Wish I could lose these blues in my heart.
(In my heart.)..

I Didn't Know What Time It Was,Billie Holiday,1957,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/billieholiday/ididntknowwhattimeitwas.html,"Once I was young 
Yesterday, perhaps 
Danced with Jim and Paul
And kissed some other chaps.
Once I was young,
But never was naive.
I thought I had a trick or two
Up my imaginary sleeve.
And now I know I was naive.

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you.
Oh, what a lovely time it was,
How sublime it was too!
I didn't know what time it was
You hold my hand.
Warm like the month of May it was,
And I'll say it was grand.

Grand to be alive, to be young,
To be mad, to be yours alone!
Grand to see your face, feel your touch,
Hear your voice say I'm all your own.

I didn't know what time it was
Live was no prize.
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes.
I'm wise,
And I know what time it is now.

Once I was old
Twenty years or so 
Rather well preserved:
The wrinkles didn't show.
Once I was old,
But not too old for fun.
I used to hunt for little girls
Up my immaginary gun.
But now I ain't for only one!

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you.
Oh, what a lovely time it was,
How sublime it was too!
I didn't know what time it was
You hold my hand.
Warm like the month of May it was,
And I'll say it was grand.

Grand to be alive, to be young,
To be mad, to be yours alone!
Grand to see your face, feel your touch,
Hear your voice say I'm all your own.

I didn't know what time it was
Live was no prize.
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes.
I'm wise,
And I know what time it is now.

Street Of Dreams,"Mathis, Johnny",1957,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnymathis/streetofdreams.html,"Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing

The Magician(2005 CD Reissue),Dean Martin,1958,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/deanmartin/themagician.html,"I met a magician
He did magical things
He said he could turn any heart
That was sad in to one that sings

I told the magician
What had happened to me
My sweetheart and I had a quarrel
And now I was blue as could be

He asked me to close my eyes
Waved his wand in the air
I looked and to my surprise
My sweetheart was there

We kissed in the moonlight
Stars were twinkling above
I suddenly knew this was no magic trick
Just the magic of love

Too Close For Comfort,"Davis Jr., Sammy",1959,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sammydavisjr/toocloseforcomfort.html,"Be firm, be fair, be sure, beware
On your guard take care
While there's such temptation
One thing will lead to another
Too late to run for cover
She's much too close for comfort now

Be wise, be smart, behave my heart
Don't upset your cart when she's so close
Be soft, be sweet, but be discreet
Don't go off your beat
She's too close for comfort

Too close, too close for comfort, please not again
Too close, too close to know just when to say when
Be firm, be fair, be absolutely sure, beware
On your guard take care

One thing will lead to another
Too late to run for cover

Be firm, be fair, be sure beware

One thing leads to another
Too late to run for cover
She's much too close for comfort now

She's much
Too much

Thank you, thank you Lord above
For smiling down on me
I'm richer now than any man
Has any right to be
Health and love and happiness have been my cup of tea
The richest man in all creation, surely it is me

A roof 'of fishing pole and folks can call me friend

Cakes that I'm gonna have Sunday
I got the Lord above and a good girl to love me
I'm the richest man in the world

I don't have much bank account my cash on hand is small
But tell me what are riches, what's the difference after all?
Other folks may think I'm poor but I know it's not so
'Cause when I count my blessings
I'm the richest man I know

I got a hump back mule, a plow and potato patch
Cakes that I'm gonna have Sunday
I got the Lord above and a good girl to love me

Now I've got all of those rich folks beat

A smoke house filled with country hams

Talk to me about caviar
They ain't nothing but fish eggs packed in a jar
I got whole pond of big brown trout
Fish eggs a what'a they talkin' about?

I ain't got no fancy swimming pool
But the creek in the woods is deep and cool
I am a lucky man
I'm a lucky fool

I'm wealthy! I'm wealthy!

I got a hump back mule, a plow and potato patch
Cakes that I'm gonna have Sunday
I got the Lord above and a good girl to love me

Down the aisle with someone else you're walking
Those wedding bells will never ring for me.

I planned a little cottage in the valley 
I even brought a little band of gold
I thought someday I'll place it on your finger
But now the future looks so dark and cold.

I fancy that I see a bunch of roses 
A blossom from an orange tree in your hair
And while the organ plays I'll love you truly 
Please let me pretend that I am there.

Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel 
Ever since the day you set me free
I knew someday that you would wed another 
But wedding bells will never ring for me...

It wasn't long till I was walking
Around in Charlie's shoes

Now, I'm wearing out
The shoes that Charlie wore
Walking back and forth
Across the floor

The troubles that drove him away
I've got for company
These nights in Charlie's shoes
Are killing me

The greener grass that turned my head
So swiftly did turn brown
'Cause every little dream I build
She's always tearing down

I never knew that Charlie's shoes
Could have so many tacks
Of disappointing sorrows
And I wish he had 'em back

'Cause I'm wearing out...

Llá 'ncimma, sulo e abbandunato

E io 'nfamo, 'nfamo 'e me, mme ne só' ghiuto
Te lasso pecché 'ammore mm'ha lassato

Tu chiagne
Quase comm'a n'ommo
Ca se lagna
E i' scénno

Da 'a muntagna

E ghiammo, ohé
Ll'ammore è sciummo ca se perde a mare
E sulo 'o mare fa scurdá ll'ammore

I Wake Up Cryin',"Richard, Cliff",1962,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cliffrichard/iwakeupcryin.html,"I wake up cryin'
After tossin' and turnin'
And a-yearnin' the whole night long
Pretty baby since you went away
I haven't spent a happy day

I wake up cryin'
After sobbin' and sighin'
And a-wonderin' just what went wrong
Pretty baby I was good to you
Why'd you go and make me blue

I need your arms to hold me tight
I need your sweet lips to kiss me goodnight
I'm so unhappy on my own
Don't don't leave me sad and lonely

I wake up cryin'
After tossin' and turnin'
And a-yearnin' the whole night long
Pretty baby please come back to me
Save me from this mesery
Oh baby won'tcha save me from this mesery
Please baby won'tcha save me from this mesery

Now all at once it's you
It's you forevermore

I'm full of foolish songs
And out my song must pour

So please forgive
This helpless haze I'm in

In love before

But this is wine
That's all too strange and strong
I'm full of foolish songs
And out my song must pour

So please forgive
This helpless haze I'm in
I've really never been
In love before

He seemed so happy holdin' you again how many times will he kiss you tonight

Why is it wrong to be

Soon enough the bluebird has to fly

We were foolish
One day we fell in love
Now we wonder
What were we dreamin' of
Smiling in the sunlight
Laughing in the rain
I wish that we were young and foolish again

Smiling in the sunlight
Laughing in the rain
I wish that we were young and foolish again

It's bad enough that I lost her
I had to lose him too
But there they go in their joy
Happy girl, lucky boy
And here am I broken hearted

Oh my heart would never ever know pain
If I hadn't ever loved in vain
But here am I broken hearted

And here's the reason why
I never knew a railroad man
Who wouldn't tell his wife a lie

With a big gold watch and chain

But if I told you I've forgotten my past, I'll be a motherless liar
I want out on the street, I want out on the world
I have been a mile of the devil's girl
I'm gonna hold my head on high and take a walk in the sun

Well she gave her heart to so many that shattered my world
Oh but a man can't ruin his life for the love of a girl
I'm gonna throw out my crotches, gonna run into the ring
Gonna let my nostrils swell with the nature of plains
I'm gonna hold my head on high and take a walk in the sun

Well she loved so many men, my heart was breaken
With every little kiss, well I be aching
Whatever I've be given to be taken
Oh but a man can't live when the story begins, begins to slip away

I'm gonna walk right down that road and never return
I know into these fires inside me are starting to burn
'Cause I don't need a girl beside me or a girl to keep me warm
Or a girl that I can talk to till the twenty hours or more
I'm gonna hold my head on high and take a walk in the sun

Desolation Row,"Dylan, Bob",1965,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bobdylan/desolationrow.html,"They're selling postcards of the hanging
They're painting the passports brown
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes the blind commissioner
They've got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants
And the riot squad they're restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady and I look out tonight
From Desolation Row.

Cinderella, she seems so easy
""It takes one to know one,"" she smiles
And puts her hands in her back pockets
Bette Davis style
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning,
""You belong to Me I Believe.""
And someone says, ""You're in the wrong place, my friend
You'd better leave.""
And the only sound that's left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row.

Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortune-telling lady
Has even taken all her things inside
All except for Cain and Abel
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody is making love
Or else expecting rain
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing
He's getting ready for the show
He's going to the carnival tonight
On Desolation Row.

Ophelia, she's 'neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday
She already is an old maid
To her, death is quite romantic
She wears an iron vest
Her profession's her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness
And though her eyes are fixed upon
Noah's great rainbow
She spends her time peeking
Into Desolation Row.

Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With his friend, a jealous monk
NOW, he looked so immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet
You would not think to look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin
On Desolation Row.

Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They ARE trying to blow it up
Now his nurse, some local loser
She's in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read
""Have Mercy on His Soul""
They all play on the penny whistle
You can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough

From Desolation Row.
Across the street they've nailed the curtains
They're getting ready for the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
In a perfect image of a priest
They are spoon-feeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls
""Get outta here if you don't know""
Casanova is just being punished for going
To Desolation Row.

At midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart-attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row.

Praise be to Nero's Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
Everybody's shouting
""Which side are you on?""
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
Fighting in the captain's tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation Row.

Yes, I received your letter yesterday
About the time the door knob broke
When you asked me how I was doing
Or was that some kind of joke?
All these people that you mention
Yes, I know them, they're quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name
Right now I can't read too good
Don't send me no more letters no
Not unless you mail them
From Desolation Row.

Ricordati Ancora,Neil Sedaka,1965,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/neilsedaka/ricordatiancora.html,"Ricordati ancora del tempo felice che abbiamo passato

Se è vero che il tempo cancella l'amore

Ma non è così... non mi devo illudere
Voglio solo te... e non posso vivere
Con i ricordi che tu mi hai lasciato

Se dopo la notte c'è un giorno di sole
Dovrebbe portare un sorriso anche a me
Ma se non ci sei... restano le lacrime
Delle notti che... ho passato a piangere
Senza il domani che avevo sognato

Ricordati ancora del tempo felice che abbiamo passato
Ricordati ti prego del tempo felice che abbiamo passato

And this aching breaking heart of mine will mend
Not until I feel your arms around me
Well, I'll be happy and I live for then and only then

All that's left inside my heart is just your echo
And the tiny thread of hope to which I cling
But if I keep holding on maybe some day
You'll remember where you left me and come back for me again

Ladies Choice,"Nelson, Ricky",1965,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rickynelson/ladieschoice.html,"Went to a dance one night
And the beautiful music was playing
And through the dim blue light
I could just see the silhouette swaying
Then all at once the room was aglow
And through the couples I could see
A pair of angel eyes and I was hypnotised
They were looking straight at me

They played a ladies choice
And I could feel my heart beating madly
For any moment she'd ask me to dance
And I would say gladly
Then someone said would you care to dance?
I turned around when I heard her voice
But it was someone else, oh how sad I felt
For I was the wrong ladies choice

And when the song was through she was alone and I caught her eye
I had to make my play before she'd dance with some other guy

So as the music played
She laid her sweet head on my shoulder
And she could see the love that I felt
As though I had told her
Was someone waiting to take her home?
I wondered who would the luck boy be?
And when the dance was through, all the world was new
For the ladies choice was me
Yeah, the ladies choice was me
Mmm, the ladies choice was me

I'm In Love For The Very First Time,Johnny Mathis,1966,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnnymathis/iminlovefortheveryfirsttime.html,"I often used to wonder

It was something that would never bother me

Like a bolt out of the blue
And it hit me and knocked me nearly flat
And that was that

Beat the drum
Bang the gong
Let the golden wedding bells chime
My heart's a-flutter
I'm walking on air
I'm in love for the very first time
Turn me loose
Set me free
I've no use for reason or rhyme
I'm hazy, crazy, but what do I care?
I'm in love for the very first time

I thought that I was freer than the birdie in the sky
Then you passed by - and wham! before I knew it
I was really going through it
Like a fish on a hook
With that dreamy, far away look
I'm as mad as a hatter
But what does it matter
Let me live and love and laugh and be merry
I'm in love for the very first time

And what a lovely feelin'
Sort of floatin' to the ceilin'
Like a bubble or a toy balloon
And it's a lot of fun
When the day is done
And you're sittin' under the moon
And isn't it surprising
That your temperature keeps rising
Though the weather may be cold and gray
And though the sun has gone
No matter what goes on
It's a lovely, lovely day

Like a fish on a hook
With that dreamy, far away look
I'm as mad as a hatter
But what does it matter
Let me live and love and laugh and be merry
I'm in love
I'm in love
For the very, very first time
I'm in love!

Was far too high...
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I...

Falling For You,Waylon Jennings,1966,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/waylonjennings/fallingforyou.html,"You bring me happiness then leave me loneliness
My world is in distress yet I keep falling for you
You look into my eyes and tell the sweetest lies
You're a heartbreak in disguise yet I keep falling for you.

Oh darling, when you're near my world is happy, dear
But when you disappear I don't know what to do
I love in misery you're so unfair to me
It's such a mystery why I keep falling for you.

Love Me Or Leave Me,"Simone, Nina",1966,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ninasimone/lovemeorleaveme.html,"Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me but I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
Night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else

There'll be no one unless that someone is you
I intended to be independently blue

I want your love, don't wanna borrow
Have it today to give back tomorrow
Your love is my love
There's no love for nobody else

Say, love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me but I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
Night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else

When you’re gone and I’m all by myself
And I need your caress

And you are back to stay

Soon is gone and this heart of mine sings

Yes, I love you so
And that for me is all I need to know
I, I will wait for you
Till the sun fall from out of the sky
For what else can I do?
I will wait for you

Breezes Of Patchulie(Bonus Track),Donovan,1966,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/donovan/breezesofpatchulie.html,"The long gone breezes are blowing down the sky.
From my window to the street I cast my weary eye.
Everything is quiet in the lonesome dusky night.
I'm feeling so alone in the darkness of my night.
I remember the days when the sun was warm with love
Softening as the day grew old in dazzling streaks of gold.
Now my days are meek, the sunset's the cruellest time
I'm feeling so alone in the darkness of my night.
I feel I want to ramble to the shores of the mighty sea
Pounding in my ears the wind so wild and free
To stumble in the high grass, the sand a-glowin' white
My eyes they feel, they break and spell the darkness of my night.
My sorrow is confusing, my love will never know
My empty hands they lie down by my sides so low
I walk this sleeping tunnel and the highway in-between bright
I'm feeling so alone in the darkness of my night.
Riding feathered wings to lick like I'm a dog
Oft I've heard the world as it cries out for some love
Cries out for someone, a little compassion and light
They're feeling so alone in the darkness of their night.

He'll spin you, he'll weave you 'round his emerald loom
And softly you'll whisper all around his ear

While the Geek's a waitin' to do his sickenin' show

Sunrise early in the dawn
Slips away, and then it's gone
Leaves the night to carry on
While it's going home

Even though it's often tried
But he was going home

Now my friends it's time to go
And this love will live to grow
And I want you all to know
I'm going home

Your pretty brown eyes keep telling me lies
But they can't hide the hurt with a smile and disguise
You can hide all your feelings until he passes by
That's when I see the blues in your pretty brown eyes.

Until I Found You,B.B. King,1968,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bbking/untilifoundyou.html,"All of my life, I've been searchin'
For someone that's lonely too
I know my darlin', I found you

I'm gonna make you happy
Oh, that's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna do all I can for you

Whenever I'm near you, oh, I can't control my self
My heart, it beats so fast until I know

I know this love is gonna last

Now, now my searchin', my searchin' is over
Oh, and I touch myself, I touch myself everyday
Because I never thought that anyone
Could make me feel this way

You know I never thought, I never thought
I never thought that anyone
Anyone could make me feel this way

Birds Of A Feather,Joe South,1968,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joesouth/birdsofafeather.html,"I remember back a long time ago
In the days of my childhood
In the evenin' when the sun's sinkin' low
Walkin' in the wildwood

Skippin' and flippin' through the flowers
We'd go hand-in-hand
Lookin' back on all the happy hours
Anybody could understand

You and me, babe
Just got to be now
Birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
We should be together
Like birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
We should be together now, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

You and I didn't have a lot of friends
Didn't have too much to say
So they never did let us join in
All the games that they used to play

Seems like it was only yesterday
Down at Lincoln Junior High
I remember what the kids used to say
As we'd go strollin' by

You and me, now
Sure 'nuff, tryin' to be now
Birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
We should be together
Like birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
Got to be together, now

Time goes rollin' by
And they say that you and I
Will go our sep'rate ways
But birds of a feather
Will always be together
Sure 'nuff, now

Your folks didn't want me hangin' 'round
Said that I was bad for you
So we'd meet on the other side of town
Down a long, dark avenue

But they can't keep the two of us apart
Long as you really love me
I got a feelin' way down in my heart
And that's the way that it's gonna be

You and me, babe
Sure 'nuff got to be, now
Birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
We should be together
Like birds of a feather

Birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
We should be together
Like birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la
We should be together
Like birds of a feather, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la, la

Little Green Apples,B.J. Thomas,1969,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bjthomas/littlegreenapples.html,"And I wake up in the morning
With my hair down in my eyes and she says hi
And I stumble to the breakfast table
While the kids are going off to school, Goodbye.
And she reaches out and takes my hand and squeezes it
And says how you feeling hon?
And I look across at smiling lips that warm my heart,
And see my morning sun.

And if that's not loving me, then all I've got to say,
God didn't make the little green apples,
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summer time.
And there's no such thing as Dr. Seuss
Or Disney Land and Mother Goose, no nursery rhymes.
God didn't make the little green apples,
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summer time.
And when myself is feeling low,
I think about her face and go and ease my mind.

Sometimes I call her up, at home,
Knowing she's busy.
And ask her if she can get away,
Meet me and maybe we can grab a bite to eat.
And she drops what she's doing
And she hurries down to meet me, and I'm always late.
But she sits waiting patiently,
And smiles when she first sees me, because she's made that way.

And if that ain't loving me, then all I've got to say,
God didn't make the little green apples,
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes.
And there's no such thing as make-believe,
Puppy dogs or autumn leaves, no BB guns.
God didn't make the little green apples,
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes.

Ribbons Down My Back,"Streisand, Barbra",1969,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/barbrastreisand/ribbonsdownmyback.html,"[Irene Molly:]
I'll be wearing ribbons down my back this summer
Blue & Green and streaming in the yellow sky
So if someone special comes my way this summer
He might notice me passing by
And so I'll try to make it easier to find me
In the stillness of July
Because a breeze might stir a rainbow up behind me
That might happen to catch the gentleman's eye
And he might smile and take me by the hand
This summer
Making me recall how lovely love can be
And so I will proudly wear
Ribbons down my back
Shining in my hair
That he might notice me!

I Just Don't Understand,"Nelson, Willie",1969,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/willienelson/ijustdontunderstand.html,"I'd be the last one to tell you that you shouldn't go.

But when you lie an' hurt someone who needs an' loves you so,
Do you mind too much if I don't understand? 

I suppose that you're convinced this is the thing to do.
Life is short an' sweet; break all the hearts you can.
I guess I shouldn't be surprised: it's all a game to you.
But do you mind too much if I don't understand? 

Forgive me but it all seems so unreal to me.
An' my heart an' me, we'd made so many plans.
But that's all over now, there's nothin' left to do.
But do you mind too much if I don't understand?

Rainmaker,"Nilsson, Harry",1969,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/harrynilsson/rainmaker.html,"First day in August
Last rain was in May
When the rainmaker came to Kansas
In the middle of a dusty day

The rainmaker said to the people
""Tell me what you are prepared to pay""
The rainmaker said to the people
""Well, I'll conjure up a rain today""

Ninety degrees 'neath the trees where it's shady
Hundred and ten in the hot sun
Heat from the street burned the feet of the ladies
See how they run

Called down the lightnin'
By a mystical name
Then the rainmaker called on the thunder
And suddenly it began to rain
Then the rainmaker passed his hat to the people
But the people all turned away
Then the rainmaker's eyes
And the Kansas skies
Both became a darker grey

First day in August
Last rain was in May
When the rainmaker came to Kansas
In the middle of a dusty day
The rainmaker smiled as he hitched up his wagon
And without a word he rode way
Then the people of the town heard the sound of his laughter
And they knew the rain had come to stay

Rain rain go away
Come again another day
Rain rain go away
Come again another day

Tea For Two,"Bennett, Tony",1971,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tonybennett/teafortwo.html,"I’m discontented with homes that are rented
So I have invented my own
Darling, this place is a lover’s oasis
Where life’s weary chase is unknown
Far from the cry of the city
Where flowers pretty caress the streams
Cozy to hide in
To live side by side
Don’t let it abide in my dreams

Picture you upon my knee
Just tea for two and two for tea
Just me for you and you for me
Alone

Nobody near us to see us or hear us
No friends or relations
On weekend vacations
We won’t have it known, dear
That we own a telephone, dear

Day will break and you’ll awake
And start to bake a sugar cake
For me to take for all the boys to see

We will raise a family
A boy for you, a girl for me
Can’t you see how happy we would be

Freedom,"Hendrix, Jimi",1971,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jimihendrix/freedom.html,"You got my pride
Hanging out of my bed
You're messin' around with my life
So I bought my lead
You even mess with my children
And you're screamin' at my wife, baby
Get off of my back
If you wanna get outta here alive

Freedom, give it to me
That's what I want now
Freedom, that's what I need now
Freedom to live
Freedom, so I can give

You got my heart
Speak electric water
You got my soul
Screamin' and howlin'
You know you hook my girlfriend
You know the drugstore man
But I don't need it now
I was trying to slap it out of her head

Freedom, so I can give
Freedom, yeah
Freedom, that's what I need

You don't have to say that you love
If you don't mean it
You'd better believe
If you need me
Or you just wanna bleed me
You'd better stickin' your dagger in someone else
So I can leave
Set me free

Right on, straight ahead
Stay up and straight ahead

Good Hearted Woman,Waylon Jennings,1972,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/waylonjennings/goodheartedwoman.html,"She's a good-hearted woman in love with a good-timin' man
She loves him in spite of his wicked ways
She don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
She's a good-hearted woman loving a good-timin' man.

Well, a long time forgotten
Dreams have just fell by the way
And the good life he promised
Ain't what she's living today
But she never complains of the bad times
Or bad things he's done
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come.

She's a good-hearted woman in love with a good-timin' man
She loves him in spite of his wicked ways
She don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
She's a good-hearted woman loving a good-timin' man.

He likes the bright light, the nite life
And good-timin' friends
When the party's all over
She'll welcome him back home again
She don't understand him,
But she does the best that she can
This good-hearted woman
Lovin' a good-timin' man.

She's a good-hearted woman in love with a good-timin' man
She loves me in spite of my wicked ways
She don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
She's a good-hearted woman loving a good-timin' man.
She's a good-hearted woman loving a good-timin' man.

O-o-o non piangere se lei ti lascera
Non pensare che perdendola non vivi piu
Al suo posto c'e una fata per te
Verra da te se questa frase canterai con me

Quel signore del piano di sopra d'altre cose mi parlo
Quella volta che scese giu da noi
Disse ""la mia casa e' la piu splendida che c'e
Notte e giorno sai
Sempre festa c'e
Ma chi ha una macchia sul vestito fuori sta
Ballare, ridere, cantare non potra con noi
La canzone della verita""

Flying Easy,"Hathaway, Donny",1973,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/donnyhathaway/flyingeasy.html,"We're flying high on a velvet sky, 
With the wind on our wings
Climbing easily on the breeze

We're flying easy and we do just what we please
we drink the breezes as we drink wine,and the nectar is sweet
Now the feeling we have is fun

We're flying easy drifting on a  summer breeze
The trip is smooth and we gently glide
We ride the rainbow and we see to a tee
how happy we can be

We gather gold from the evening sun
And it's heavenly hues
And we don't have a thing to  lose

We're flying easy and we do just what we choose

The trip is smooth and we gently glide
We ride the rainbow and we see to a tee
How happy it can be to be free

We float and there is no thought of time
Cause were singing of love
And the pleasure is so devine

We're flying easy not a worry on our mind
We're flying easy not a worry on our mind
We're flying easy on a breeze
Flying, flying flying

The sands of time will ease
All the burdens you have carried

The strangest things unfold to you
Stories you thought never true
And you know that it's only begun

This rain in my heart, it keeps on falling
This feeling for you still remains
I will try to be more than a friend to you
And I'll never refuse you again
No, I'll never refuse you again

Like a dream in the night
You keep calling to my heart
We'll get by, though the tears and the sighs
Will be trying to break us apart

tell ol' sam we'll pay him off you can catch a ride when you get to the black-top road don't forget the coffee Billy Joe""

Put in a dime and I'll take the time

Still can't stop thinking
About all those long nights alone
If tear drops start falling
And you keep on calling
To find out there's nobody home

I've been feeling down
Talking to Tony and Mario

You know they make good conversation
But girl that ain't no consolation
Cos I got love and baby I'll give you some
And if somebody comes we'll let the door bell ring

Ring ring golden ring
Around the sun around your pretty finger
Ring ring voices ring
With a happy tune anybody can be a singer

The sun comes up across the city
I swear you never looked so
Dog gone pretty

Hand in hand
We'll stand upon the sand
With the preacher man
And let the wedding bell ring

Cosmik Debris,Frank Zappa,1974,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/frankzappa/cosmikdebris.html,"The Mystery Man came over

I could reach nervonna t'nite
If I was ready, willing 'n able
To pay him his regular fee
He would drop all the rest of his pressing affairs
And devote His Attention to me
But I said...
Look here brother,
Who you jivin' with that Cosmik Debris?
(Now who you jivin' with that Cosmik Debris?)
Look here brother,
Don't you waste your time on me

The Mystery Man got nervous
An' he fidget around a bit
He reached in the pocket of his Mystery Robe
An' he whipped out a shaving kit
Now, I thought it was a razor
An' a can of foamin' goo
But he told me right then when the top popped open
There was nothin' his box won't do
With the oil of Afro-dytee
An' the dust of the Grand Wazoo
He said:
""You might not believe this, little fella, but it'll cure your Asthma too!""
An' I said...
Look here brother,
Who you jivin' with that Cosmik Debris?
(Now what kind of a geroo are you anyway?)
Look here brother,
Don't you waste your time on me
Don't waste yer time...

I've got troubles of my own, I said
An' you can't help me out
So take your meditations an' your preparations
An' ram it up yer snout
""BUT I GOT A KRISTL BOL!,"" he said
An' held it to the light
So I snatched it
All away from him
An' I showed him how to do it right
I wrapped a newspaper 'round my head
So I'd look like I was Deep
I said some Mumbo Jumbos then
An' told him he was goin' to sleep
I robbed his rings
An' pocket watch
An' everything else I found
I had that sucker hypnotized
He couldn't even make a sound
I proceeded to tell him his future then
As long as he was hanging around,
I said
""The price of meat has just gone up
An' yer ol' lady has just gone down...""
Look here brother,
Who you jivin' with that Cosmik Debris?
(Now is that a real poncho or is that a Sears poncho?)
Don't you know,
You could make more money as a butcher,
So don't you waste your time on me

Being Green,"Ross, Diana",1974,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dianaross/beinggreen.html,"One day, as I was walking through my garden, I saw a little frog lying on the ground. And I thought he was sick. So I picked him up and he wasn't sick at all. He was very sad, and he was crying. And I said: What's a matter with you, little frog? And he looked up at me with a lump in his throat, and he said: wribbit!

It ain't easy being green
Having to spend each day the color of the leaves
When I think, I think it would be nicer being red
Or yellow or gold

You see, it ain't easy being green
It seems to blend in with so many other ordinary things
And then, sometimes, sometimes people pass over you
Because you're not standing out like sparkles on the water
Or like the stars in the sky

But did you know that green is the color of Spring
And green can be big like an ocean
And important like a mountain
And cool and friendly-like
Or tall and skinny like a tree
And me

But when green is all there is to be
It kind of makes you wonder why
Why wonder, wonder why?
Hey, I'm green and I think it'll do fine
'Cause green is just what I wanna be
'Cause green is beautiful, baby
Right on green
And anyway, money's green

Go in any place that I want to go one of these days

I might someday walk across this land and carry the Lord's Book in my hand
Goin' cross the country singin' loud as I can one of these days
But I won't have trouble on my back cuttin' like the devil with a choppin' axe
I got to shake it off of my back one of these days

One of these days it will soon be all over cut and dry
And I won't have this urge to go all bottled up inside
One of these days I'll look back and I'll say I left in time
Cause somewhere for me I know there's peace of mind
There's gotta be peace of mind for me one of these days

Check it out

Have a party night
Disco satellites
Everybody was groovin'
We were movin'
Girl I used to know
I bumped into her right at the door
Groovin'
We were movin'

With just a little time
I'd like to make you mine
I got you on the floor
This time I know
You don't have to go
Don't have to go
Don't have to go
No, no you don't have to go

Hearts will party down
Just dancing with the people around
Groovin'
Everybody was movin'

My girl is so fancy free
Such a face so exciting to me
Get down with me baby
We were moving
Having cheese and wine
Dancing all the time
And I had just turned around
Little fine girl she was just getting down

All the sweet loving
Give me all your sweet loving
All of it, all of it, all your sweet loving
All your sweet loving
Give me all your sweet loving
Give me all your sweet loving
All of it, all of it, all your sweet loving
All your sweet loving

Hey hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey hey
The set had just begun
I looked up and my girl was gone
Get down with me baby
She was moving
The place was in a groove
And really on the move
Dripping on the floor
All I could do was pray for more

Give me all your sweet loving
All of it, all of it, all your sweet loving
All your sweet loving
Give me all your sweet loving
Give me all your sweet loving
All of it, all of it, all your sweet loving

Virginia's Reel,"Clark, Guy",1976,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/guyclark/virginiasreel.html,"Now gents to the middle said a young girls fiddle
And you ain't got nothin' to lose
Allemande right she can play it all night
She can fiddle off the bottom of your shoes

Oh me, oh my, how she makes that bow hair fly
How she hangs that music in the air

Now promenade down to the lonesome sound
Of a whippoorwill in the night
Sashay back look at old mad Jack
Huggin' everything in sight, he said

""Oh me, oh my, how she makes that bow hair fly
How she hangs that music in the air""

Now Banjo Bill he stopped stock still
As the notes came a rollin' by
And it filled his ears and eased his fears
And a tear come to his eye, he said

""Oh me, oh my, how she makes that bow hair fly
How she hangs that music in the air""

Now the old String Bass he lost his place
And his arms they felt like steel
And the guitar man dropped both his hands
And he swore it was not real, he said

""Oh me, oh my, how she makes that bow hair fly
How she hangs that crystal in the air""

Now it's golden strings on eagles wings
To the callin' of the squares
And there's fiddle tunes and there's fiddle tunes
But Virginia's splittin' hairs

Oh me, oh my, how she makes that bow hair fly
How she hangs that music in the air

Now she cast a spell no tongue can tell
No Prophet can reveal
And quiet as death, hold your breath
She played Virginia's real

Oh me, oh my, how she makes that bow hair fly
How she hangs that music in the air

And it's oh me, oh my, how she makes that bow hair fly
How she hangs that crystal in the air

And holding something special from the past.

Only The Good Die Young,Billy Joel,1977,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/billyjoel/onlythegooddieyoung.html,"Come out, Virginia, don't let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
But sooner or later it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one
They showed you a statue and told you to pray
They built you a temple and locked you away
But they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done...
Only the good die young

You might have heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
But that never hurt no one
So, come on, Virginia, show me a sign
Send up a signal I'll throw you the line
The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind
Never lets in the sun
Darling, only the good die young

You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation
You got a brand new soul
And a cross of gold
But, Virginia, they didn't give you quite enough information
You didn't count on me
When you were counting on your rosary

They say there's a heaven for those who will wait
Some say it's better but I say it ain't
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
The sinners are much more fun...
You know that only the good die young

You say your mother told you all that I could give you was a reputation
She never cared for me
But did she ever say a prayer for me?

Come out, come out, come out
Virginia, don't let me wait,
You Catholic girls start much too late,
But sooner or later it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one,
You know that only the good die young
Tell you baby
You know that only the good die young
Only the good die young
Only the good
Only the good die young

Gypsy Boy,Billy Joe Shaver,1977,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/billyjoeshaver/gypsyboy.html,"The painted lantern circus
With the wagons swinging slowly
On a cold October morning
On a day that should be holy

Winding through the forest
As the sun is just a-breakin'
And I am only seven
And a gypsy in the makin'

Winds a-blowin' through me
And the canvas flaps a-tearin'
And the folks is talkin' low now
'Cause they don't want me to hear 'em

And Uncle says there's trouble
With the bulls along the border
And I'm a-wond'rin' why
And a-wishin' I were older

Many years ago it seems
And many summers ending
The wagon wheels is rustin'
And the axles is a-bendin'

And Grandma's bones is bleachin'
And our hearts is still a-dyin'
But I'm a Gypsy Boy
And there ain't no time for cryin'

Now it's getting colder
And the air is growin' ugly
And the wolves is gettin' bolder
And there ain't no sun above me

And I think it's time to move now
But I don't know where we're goin'
And I know it won't be long now
Before it starts to snowin'

Babies cryin' softly
And the women are a-sighin'
And somewhere in a wagon
There's a soul that must be dyin'

'Cause the crepe is hangin' black
From the window of each lorry
And we'll likely camp at sunset
So's the body can be buried

So the carts will rumble
Though there ain't no road to travel
And I listen to the grindin'
Of the wooden wheels on gravel

And the sad songs and the old songs
Will warm me and they'll hold me
'Til my head at last grows weary
And the arms of sleep enfold me

For I am a Gypsy Boy
And my home is where you find me
For I am a Gypsy Boy
And my home is where you find me

What's Next To The Moon,AC/DC,1978,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/acdc/whatsnexttothemoon.html,"Well, I tied my baby to the railroad track
Cannonball down the line
Givin' that woman just a one more chance
Give it to me one more time
Engineer wishin' he was home in bed
Dreamin' 'bout Casey Jones
Wide-eyed woman, half a mile ahead
Thinkin' 'bout broken bones

It's your love that I need
It's your love, gotta have

Superman was outta town
Come on, honey, gotta change your tune

Think about Lois Lane
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a suicide
And that'd be a shame

Long arm lookin' for a finger print
Tryna find a mystery clue
Hittin' me with the third degree
Workin' on the thumbscrew
Alright, officer, I confess
Everything's comin' back
I didn't mean to hurt that woman of mine
It was a heart attack

It's your love that I need
It's your love, gotta have
It's your love guaranteed

The love that I want

It's your love, gotta have

Oh, baby, say ""bye-bye""
You're right next to the moon

Oh, I've been around the moon

Out in some room in the wind
Your hands they were folded
You knew no demands
My tongue, it clattered like tin
My eyes repeat, they take my seat
Your eyes they say you resigned from the heat

We leaned in the cold, holding our breath
Watching the corners turn corners
Coins on the table, the cards in the air
The face at the window kept smiling
Storms all that winter we stayed locked away
Waiting, watching, falling

End of the street
Horizon retreats
You ran with it
I wish I could
Sleep is not sleep
My eyes repeat
You take the voltage that watches you weep
You caught the voice
I listen close
All I heard was the echoes

Praise emptiness
Her rose-colored dress
Her circling motions
Praise emptiness
Everything scattered, nothing was missed
We took our house in the fire

Listen to the trees sigh
Standing in the freezin’ wind and feeling the old year die
Catching the winter’s chilly kiss in the grey and the lowering sky
Better check there’s kindling in the box, put on two pair of good warm socks
No need to ask me why
Listen to the trees sigh
It always catches me unawares
Frost on the redwood picnic chairs
Birds I’m used to seeing fly away
The child within me starts to glow
When the air begins to taste of snow
And I dream my crazy dream of a one-horse sleigh
Listen to the bells ring
Up and down the snowy hill attached to wooden sleds
Bells on woollen mittens, bells on goggled, woollen heads
You wanna take a laughing spill, try your luck on a snowy hill
Wanna hear winter sing

Waiting for the bus
Will that be us?

Selling our soul to buy

To a level where the clouds turn into fire
In the warmness of the fire

It's a strong and true vibration,
You can feel it on your skin

Now come and take my hand
And we will dance
Upon the wind
So you wanted to meet the wizard!!

Break down way down inside

You'd like Pisty she's a friend of mine
Pisty is a good dog and she guards me all the time
She's about that tall and about that long and she loves to hear me sing her in a song

Now Pisty keeps the bad guys on the run
She guards me from the milkman when he comes
She guards me from the mailmain when he rings
And she doesn't like the man who fixes things
And you'd like Pisty...

Now your dog can have a song about it too
And I bet its name would fit right in this tune
So I'll leave my dog out next time we start
And you can put your dog right in that part
And you'd like...

I Never Thought,"Berry, Chuck",1979,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/chuckberry/ineverthought.html,"You know I never really thought some things would ever really come to be
'Cause I don't bother nobody and don't nobody bother me

I went down in Mississippi, I asked Mister Charlie about my roots
He said, ""Turn around, bend over, boy, they're right here in my boots""
You know I never thought a thing like that would ever really come to be
'Cause I don't bother nobody and don't nobody bother me

I asked a policeman the time, he swung and crowned me with his stock
I managed to walk away so glad it weren't twelve o'clock
You know I never thought a thing like that would ever really come to be
'Cause I don't bother nobody and don't nobody bother me

My girl friend's datin' this here guy who's goin' out with some man's wife
I lost my girl, the wife her husband, the guy he lost his life
You know I never thought a thing like that would ever really come to be
'Cause I don't bother nobody and don't nobody bother me

I used to have a Ford Torino and at that time I had a chick
She used to get her kicks just askin' me to flick my Bic
You know I never thought a thing like that would ever really come to be
'Cause I don't bother nobody and don't nobody bother me

My grandpa drove a horse and buggy but my father used the train
I worked and bought a Cadillac but my son, he drives a plane
You know I never thought a thing like that would ever really come to be
'Cause I don't bother nobody and don't nobody bother me

Gas Line Romance,Tom Paxton,1980,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tompaxton/gaslineromance.html,"I met my love
At the end of the line
She was sittin’ in hers
I was sittin’ in mine
We were waiting for gas
Out Santa Monica way
It was beginning to look like
It would take all day
We were fated to meet
And I can show you how
Our licence plates were both even
And we both said - oh wow
We were inching forwards
We continued to chat
We both turned out to be Pisces
Can you imagine that
Though she answered to Bambi
Her folks had named her Ruth
Her licence plate was so humble
It simply said ‘For Truth’
I said this crisis
Was gettin’ me down
Bambi said she was counting
On Jerry Brown
Jerry Brown was her hero
Bambi thought he was cool
I replied I can hear you
He is nobody’s fool
He knows about music
He knows about dress
You talk about Jerry
You’re talkin’ gas
We finally got to the gas pump
Bambi got her gas
To me they said sorry
But that was the last
I blushed and remembered
But I confessed that I cried
As Bambi seemed to grow cooler
My engine spluttered and died
The last I saw of my true love
She was pulling away
She said she would see me
We’d take a meeting someday
Goodbye to my Bambi
There’s a tear in my eye
I’ll remember forever
The day the pumps went dry

Out Of Control,U2,1980,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/u2band/outofcontrol.html,"Monday morning
Eighteen years dawning
I said how long
Say how long

It was one dull morning
I woke the world with bawling
I was so sad
They were so glad

I had the feeling it was out of control
I was of the opinion it was out of control

Boys and girls to school
And girls they make children
Not like this one

I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion it was out of control

I fought fate
There's blood at the garden gate
The man said childhood
It's in his childhood

One day I'll die
The choice will not be mine
Will it be too late?
You can't fight fate

I was of the feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion it was out of control

'Goodbye I'm gonna miss you'
And all the things you say at a leaving
Ah just turn your head and walk away

Goodbye little Columbus
Goodbye, I'll see you one day
Goodbye little Columbus
Travelling, just travelling

That certain moment, the final call
And that desperate search for 'C'est la vie'
Oh what you'd give to hear of a slight delay
Ah just turn your head and walk away
Walk away, just walk away

Goodbye little Columbus
Goodbye, I'll see you one day
Goodbye little Columbus
Travelling, just travelling
You've made up your mind
And you've got to go

Trouble,Bob Dylan,1981,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bobdylan/trouble.html,"Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm
But they can't help you none when there's trouble.

Trouble
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Nothing but trouble.

Trouble in the water, trouble in the air
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there
Revolution even ain't no solution for trouble.

Trouble
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Nothing but trouble.

Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul
Persecution, execution, governments out of control
You can see the writing on the wall inviting trouble.

Trouble
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Nothing but trouble.

Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around ?
Since the beginning of the universe man's been cursed by trouble.

Trouble
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Nothing but trouble.

Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble.

Trouble
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Nothing but trouble.

She's A Super Lady,"Vandross, Luther",1981,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/luthervandross/shesasuperlady.html,"[Chorus: x2]
She's a Superlady,
She is, too much,
Wish I could make her mine,

What a superlady,
A-ha, alright,
She's so fine,

[Verse 1:]
Not long ago I was,
A sad and lonely boy,
Did not know how to get better,

Then heaven up above,
Sent me a super love,
And now I'm happy forever.

No one wants to believe,
I've got a perfect love,
They say I'm just talking crazy,

But I can prove it's true,
If you'l allow me to,
Tell you 'bout my Super Lady

[B-Section:]
She's all that I could explore,
She's more than a dream,
She's my everthing

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2:]
Whoever thought I would,
Be feeling half this good,
The world for me is new place,

I'll drink to happiness,
Because our love's the best,
The wine for me has a new taste,

I'll let my lady know,
I'll never let her go,
Forever I'm gonna hold on,

She said she feel's the same,
Don't wanna play no game,
Just wants our love to live on and on,

[B-Section 2:]
Wish I could fly to the sky,
And write out her name,

Climb to the top of the world,
And loudly exclaim,
She's my everything
(She's my everything)

She's got that super love
She's much, too much for my heart

Together Alone,"Jones, George",1981,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/georgejones/togetheralone.html,"She watches movies but he don't
He watches football but she won't
They've got a lonely house to hold together

His Playboy pictures turn him on
Her heart's so cold and lonely stone
Get big on and on and on there together

Together alone, together alone
They're at the house and they're not at home
Together alone

No angry words that they'll regret
They're never fuss or fighting yet
Sleep side by side but seldom get all together

They wanna plod outside of time
With them the maples gathered round
Someday they'll lie beneath the ground there together

Together alone, together alone
They're not unlike so many I've known
Together alone, together alone, together alone

Tigers hide inside alley cats eyes

Underneath this tranquil attitude

I feel I could color the sky
Amazon blue

Oh it's you

And it's me

On the boulevard

Caught inside your spell it's your parade
Refugees from love we masquerade
Though your lover is waiting at home
I have one of my own
I must go to

Found the door

Last Rites,Tom Robinson,1982,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomrobinson/lastrites.html,"Mother nature has a way of fighting resistance
Punishing me for an imperfect existence
But in reality this free society
Fears the man who seeks alliance

If I should die, it won't solve a great deal
It won't change the way that people feel
I wish to God that I could pray
But I feel he's made me pay
For a life I've been trying to conceal

Oh I don't really mind the pain
My strength for loneliness is getting higher
Unless it starts to rain
I'll keep adding fuel to fire

Up till now I've had nothing to complain about
But now it seems that I've lost
More friends than I can count
Oh must I face it quite alone?
They won't even use the phone
There can be no doubt

Oh I don't really mind the pain
As the media feed up my fire
I don't need their selfish gain
As I watch their readership get higher...

Man could not have been created without flaws
Sure we expected to lose a few wars
Yes I know that I'm crying
Well I'm shit scared of dying
When we ourselves opened the door

And yes I really mind the pain
My strength for loneliness is getting lower
It may never rain - for personally
The search seems to be...
Getting slower

When the children laughed
I was always afraid
Of the smile of the clown
So I close my eyes
Till I can't see the light
And I hide from the sound

Of a leaf on a tree
As it falls to the ground
I can hear the call
Of an echoing voice
And there's no one around

Now years have passed things have changed since we moved into town
The little girl I grew up with is your woman now I found
And now the sidewalks of the city where wild temptation flows
Is her new playground and the playmates of Rose.

So if you're the one that's holdin' her tight
Somewhere out there at night
Please don't treat her as if she's just another girl
From off the street
And please don't do her wrong for her pride is almost gone
For you see Rose means the world to me
I love the girl you found out in the world
The girl that every man knows
But I love her today so different from your way
For you see I'm the brother of Rose...

Children Of The Universe,John Denver,1982,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johndenver/childrenoftheuniverse.html,"A heritage of vision was given to us all to smell the rose's fragrance, to hear the songbird's call.
To watch the distant moonlight fill the coming of the tides,
to understand that life is more than always choosing sides.

And some have seen what can be seen of sailing ships and kings.
And some are given feet of clay and some are given wings.
Some must struggle just to breathe, some have a golden spoon.
And some will never leave the nest while some walk on the moon.

And don't you know the life that lives within the silent hills
is just as rich and beautiful and just as unfulfilled.
As man with all his intellect, his reason and his choice,
oh, who's to say the nightingale has any less a voice.

The silver dolphins twist and dance and sing to one another,
the cosmic ocean knows no bounds for all that live are brothers.
The whippoorwill, the grizzly bear, the elephant, the whale,
all children of the universe, all weavers of the tale.

So palomino, lie back down and dream yourself to sleep.
The hawk flies with the morning dove, the lion with the sheep.
As far away as you may go, we'll never be apart.
It's in your dreams that you will know the seasons of the heart.

The Sun Goes Down (Living It Up),Level 42,1983,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/level42/thesungoesdownlivingitup.html,"Though I live in the edge time is on my side
All the doors to my life are open wide
Just as long as the wheels keep on turning round
I will live for the groove 'til the sun goes down

Living it up ... living it up ... I can feel it
Living it up ... is it a crazy notion?
Living it up ... living it up ... I can feel it
Living it up ... I got forward motion

I don't wanna go to war, I don't wanna go to war
I said I know what I want an' I don't wanna go to war
Do you follow me?
I saw a soldier standing in a bar, looked so tired, he'd come so far
He said ""I need to love someone before they drop the atom bomb""

There's a girl at the back making eyes at me
And her hair long and black is a sight to see
But I get kind of scared when love's around
I just live for the groove 'til the sun goes down

Living it up ... living it up ... I can feel it
Living it up ... is it a false emotion?
Living it up ... living it up ... I can feel it
Living it up ... I got forward motion

So I'm-a-taking you out but I'm-a-faking
I'm married to the beat
To the music I gave the heart I could have given you-hoo
Still there's something 'bout the way that you move
And the way the people stare, it's the shock of the new
I want my friends to see me standing next to you

The sun goes down

Time is on my side
I don't care what they say, I'll enjoy the ride
But I get kind of scared when I turn around
So I'll stay with the groove 'til the sun goes down

Living it up ... living it up ... I can feel it
Living it up ... I got forward motion

Ooh watch her dance
There must be one like her in every club in every town
But I don't mind if that's the way she wants to be
There something 'bout her that reminds me of me
She's my soulmate - we'll be together 'til the sun goes down

Living it up ... living it up ... I can feel it
Living it up ... I got forward motion

Querida,"Serrat, Joan Manuel",1983,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/joanmanuelserrat/querida.html,"Disculpe que insista, querida
Pero es imprescindible su colaboración
Para saber dónde se me ha perdido
La muchacha que hace un rato
Estaba aquí conmigo
Echándole aceite a mi lamparilla
Tratándome como a uno de la familia
No sabe con cuánto mimo
Cuida esas cosas que usted tanto desprecia de mí

Vea mis dedos desde que no la toco
Menguando entre mis propias manos poco a poco
Me vienen anchos los pantalones
Hablo solo y sufro alucinaciones
Le importaría darse la vuelta?
Déjeme verla de frente
Póngase aquí en la luz junto a la puerta
Se le parece tanto físicamente
Avíseme si volviera
No es por capricho
Le juré amor eterno y no quisiera
Quedar en entre dicho
Y parece todo tan fácil
Como extender la mano
Y es tan lejano
Y tan frágil
Que estoy tentado a emprender hoy mismo
Un curso acelerado de transformismo

Esconda las uñas, querida
No soy el enemigo
No es esa mi intención
Sólo sospecho que es usted quien esconde
Contra su voluntad
Algo que me corresponde
Póngale fin a este disparate
Vengo dispuesto negociar el rescate
Le importaría que eche un vistazo
Por sus intimidades
Que me dé un chapuzón entre sus brazos
Prescindiendo de formalidades?
Avíseme si volviera
No es por capricho
Le juré amor eterno y no quisiera
Quedar en entredicho

Eggheart,Hunters & Collectors,1983,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/hunterscollectors/eggheart.html,"This song is dedicated to the sacred beaches of this great nation
Where fifty thousand naked men and women prime their bodies
With intensive care barrier cream and confront the liquid universe
So we're lying around upon hot sand
The health food of a nation's cream
Inside our wet skin and
Here comes the great sun-struck question
Hear it go twisting, twisting
Yeah one little sun-struck question
And it goes twisting, twisting
Oh yeah and yeah again
Well it's a real head song this one
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Well it's a real brain song this one
Now what is this sun-struck object
Inside your ice-cream eyes
Yeah one little sun-struck object and
We won't let it sweat, we won't let it cry
Let it sweat, let it cry
And with some old egg-heart trouble
I say give-me-gas
Give-me-gas
Hear my hard boiled egg-heart beat
We go twisting!

Ci fermiamo un momento a respirare
Il passato alle nostre spalle
E più avanti può darsi ci sia il mare.

Sei molto pallida, non dormi mai
Sempre bellissima, sempre nei guai
Come stai? Come stai? - Come... stai?

Sulle sponde del fiume folle
Sta coperta che l'aria si fa bruma
Come un cucciolo nel tuo scialle
Mi domandi di accenderti la luna.

Sei molto pallida, non dormi mai
Sempre incertissima, sempre nei guai
Come stai? Come stai? Come... stai?

Piccoli viaggi nel tempo che va
Siamo miraggi e nessuno lo sa
Come va?

Siamo gli ostaggi del tempo che va
Solo miraggi e nessuno lo sa
Come va? Come va? - Come... va?

Sulle sponde del fiume folle...

Now I forget what I was fighting for
I played the game
I lost
I even took the blame
I lost
I think I'll change my name
To lost
I'll never be the same anymore
So tell the whole world
I'm not here, I'm somewhere else and I'm not coming back

Cos I'm gone to pieces
Out to lunch
Gone to pieces
Tired of running with the bunch

I'm tired of going to the wall
When I had nothing but the best intentions
I'm sick of answering the call
Of alexander graham bell's inventions
I took a gamble every day
I lost
I didn't wanna play
I lost
Down each and every by way
I lost
And yes I even did it my way
So tell the whole world I'm not me I'm someone else
And he's gone with me too.

Gone to pieces
Out to lunch gone to pieces
Tired of running with the bunch

In his hand a blade of solid steel

He feels his driving, satisfaction he needs
He's watching your pussy, he will his food
And when he arose you think it's a lover
But he likes strange practices, you'll discover

You lie on your bed
You view real seems great
But instead of his prick
He's drawing his blade
Oh, he's so tender
When he made love to you
That you couldn't stand it
It's apathy for you

Astronomy,Jethro Tull,1984,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jethrotull/astronomy.html,"The middle lane has trapped my car
in red-light claustrophobia.
I slip the shackles, cut the rope ---
stand naked with a telescope
as the cat walks alone
under a big sky.
Against the dark so thin and white ---
gonna be a big sky night.

Miss Galileo, come with me
and view the new Astronomy.
Black hole dressing on salad plate ---
quasar at the kissing gate.
Now the cat, he walks alone
under a big sky.
Umbrella dome pin-pricked in lights ---
gonna be a big sky night.

My spectacles, my white lab coat ---
my coffee, thermos and my notes.
I pat my pockets. I got the keys
to the secrets of the observatory.
And closing the door,
I feel a new dawn
as the darker slides align ---
you to yours and me to mine.

And now you stand, assisting me ---
I can touch what I can see, see, see.
I look in wonder, I feel no shame ---
see the consequences of the game.
Expand the universe.
Head for the Big Bang.
Reach for my switch and shout ---
gonna turn the big sky out.

There's got to be astronomy.
Astronomy.

How do we know?

Where do we go?
All the way
Too far
Don't be afraid
Tell me how far
Love can take us all the way

Reckless love, it gives too much too soon
Still, what I feel is wrapped up in you
But hearts don't beg when they're only passing through

Where do we go?

From here
It's not far
How do we know?
It's a case of taking heart
Where do we go?

Don't be afraid
Tell me how far
Love can take us all the way

Of those who didn't take it all the way

From here
It's not far
How do we know?
It's a case of taking heart

Where do we go?
All the way
From here
It's not far

It's a case of taking heart

Where do we go?

Tell me how far

Of eternal youth
Got an ice-cold diamond in his tooth
And the walls will tumble
When he hits the roof

Oh it's hard to break
A mystery
A double dealing hero
To bring you down to zero
His origins unknown
And he ain't got no home

He's into shooting stars
Eccentric cars
Grew up fussing, fighting, in the bars
All he's got to show for it's
The battle scars
The myzsterious mizster Jones

Whatever makes him tick
Go take you pick
With a five line rhyming limerick
Is it his silver tongue
Well maybe that's the trick
Of the myzstirious mizster Jones

How every circle comes around
Nobody went, but everyone came
You and I standing here again
Thinking about what might have been
Ready to go our separate ways

One more night
We could have been in love
One more night
We could have stayed in love
I guess we ask
For more than we ever get
But I would give the world
Baby, if I could say
What we had for one more night

Funny when things that don't seemed clear
Where are we gonna go from here
You without me and me without you
Somehow I prayed the days won't end
And when the darkness comes again
Don't believe I'll make it through

We could have been in love
One more night
We could have stayed in love
I guess we ask
For more than we ever get
But I would give the world

If I could turn back the time
For you and me

Let every heart prepare Him room

That leads up to grandma's place
Someone cuttin' down the evergreen
They're gonna decorate

And miles away the bells are ringing on a street downtown
There're smiling faces everywhere and magic all around

You can hear the voices of rejoicing love rejoicing love
Singing joy to the world from up above
Bringing peace, good will to men
It's that special time again
You can hear the voices of rejoicing love

From Tennessee to Jerusalem families gather from far and wide
Here the smell of cookin' from Grandma's kitchen carries them all inside
And where cannons roar, they're silent for the crying of a child
And enemies or brother if only for a while

Later on in the silent night while the whole world's fast asleep
There's a feeling in the stillness by the light of the Christmas tree

We're gonna find a new way to love

Maybe we could learn to like the same things, maybe
Discover the joy that togetherness brings, baby
We could share our records, we could see the same plays
Even plan our vacations for the very same days
We'll put our lives in phase, livin' in a happiness haze
Well it may not be easy, but then nothin' else was
Ask a mountain climber why he does what he does
He'll tell you just because, I need to find a new way
Hey now we've got a mountain of our own to rise above
We're gonna find a new way to love

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Maybe we don't need to see eye to eye, maybe
We don't need to vote for the very same guy, baby
You can move to the left whenever I keep right
I'm a big bad wolf, you can be Snow White
I've got a huge appetite, you wanna eat light
I'm down here beggin' for more, you tell me you've had enough
We gotta find a new way to love

[Chorus 4x]

We're gonna find a new way to love

Guardian Of The Blind,Blind Guardian,1988,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blindguardian/guardianoftheblind.html,"Extermination thunder the strange one is back again
Lost by our only power it's aura will grind us out forever
Fall into a dark dream that we got once
the part it's real you won't believe
We're watching our own agony many years ago
Seven little children stand against the ghost
Believing is the answer but you've lost before
Find back to your infancy it's time to die
I've been the herdsman you've been my sheep
I find taste on lampskin everything's allright
killing for the thirst for small children sweat
I give them illusions to raise their fear
Hear the crying dying child it's music to my ears
Feel the sweetness of it's death everything's allright
But there's a new feeling I've never known
There must be a third one a mighty guardian

Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind
Now it feel the curse of heaven
Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind
Now it feel the curse of the child

Dark is it's world. and lonely we're reaching it again
Fear our returning visions to madness we'll fall
if we can't kill the beast forever we must die now
One has blown his life away
Once we were a circle fighting hand in hand
Our weapons were illusions to let it feel the pain
By the sweet taste of our live it call us back again
We'll find the answer it's time to die
By a ritual we've hurt it but we've not kill
little Billy you must find your way
Believe in you we ask for but where
we can never find
there must be a sign for the
Guardian of the Blind

Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind
Now it feel the curse of heaven
Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind
Now it feel the curse
Come to it's world following the sign

Give us the help we're waiting for your sign

Change Of Heart,Four Tops,1988,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fourtops/changeofheart.html,"Hey girl, he treats you bad
Leaves you at home on your own while he roams
Said he was out with the boys
Smells like sweet perfume
Lipsticks on his collar
His pockets ain't got a dollar
He staggers and he falls asleep
In the same clothes that he wore in the street
Wakes up and demands to eat
You're in this thing mighty deep

What you need is a change of heart
What you need is a change of life
I know you got to have a change of man, change to me
What you need is a change of heart
What you need is a change of life
In fact I know you need a change of man, change to me

Every Saturday night he wants to start a fight with you
Either she ain't treatin' him right
Or just because he's high as a kite
He blames you because the sun didn't shine
And he blames you for what's wrong with his mind
He uses you as a scapegoat
If you can't see it
Let me pull your coat
He uses reverse psychology on you
Remember when you caught him with Nona
Didn't he accuse you of being with some creep?
Girl you're in this thing mighty deep

What you need is a change of heart
In fact I know you need a change of life
What you need is a change of man, change to me
What you need is a change of heart
Change of life
Change of man, change to me

Start me think about it he never says he loves you
And I don't think he do, do you?
I think he only thinks of you as he would an old worn out shoe

Change to me, think about it baby!
Change to me!

Change of heart
What you need is a change of life
In fact I know you need a change your man, change to me
In fact I know you need a change of heart
You really [?] change of life
What you need is a change of man, change to me

Change my evil ways and be your loving man

Tender Comrade,Billy Bragg,1988,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/billybragg/tendercomrade.html,"What will you do when the war is over, tender comrade
When we lay down our weary guns
When we return home to our wives and families
And look into the eyes of our sons
What will you say of the bond we had, tender comrade
Will you say that we were brave
As the shells fell all around us
Or that we wept and cried for our mothers
And cursed our fathers
For forgetting that all men are brothers

Will you say that we were heroes
Or that fear of dying among strangers
Tore our innocence and false shame away
And from that moment on deep in my heart I knew
That I would only give my life for love

Brothers in arms in each other arms
Was the only time that I was not afraid
What will you do when the war is over, tender comrade
When we cast off these khaki clothes
And go our separate ways
What will you say of the bond we had
Tender comrade

Love is gaining on you you're just about to fall
If you're afraid to love afraid to take a chance
You better hide your feelings get out while you can

'Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco

Memories are lost and found
Leaving broken hearts all over town

If you stay too long
Yes you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong

You'll be pulling out your hair drowning in despair
With a whole lot of nothing on your way to nowhere
Your search for paradise will come to an end
When you realize what a fool you've been

You'll be haunted by her face
Missing her warm embrace
Memories of loving her
Holding her tight every night
Was that the best part of your life?
Hearing her voice soft and low
Begging you to please
Please don't go
Don't go
No! Don't go! Don't go!

You can hear voices bleeding through those warm Latin nights
Memories are lost and found
Leaving broken hearts all over town, all over town

'Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Yes you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong

Going loco down in Acapulco if you stay too long

The Word Justice,"Browne, Jackson",1989,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jacksonbrowne/thewordjustice.html,"A man stands up before God and country
Raises his right hand and takes an oath
Swears he has acted in the line of duty
And he more than anyone wants to tell the truth

But there is a need to keep some things a secret
Some weapons shipments-some private wars
In the future democracy will be defended
Behind closed doors

Now the men of Congress who convene to determine
If covert war is a business or a crime
Are the same men who routinely give their permission
For the shedding of blood in security's name

And there is a need to keep some things a secret
The names of some countries-the terms of some deals
And above all the sound of the screams of the innocent
Beneath our wheels

Does the word justice mean anything to you?
Are the features of a lie beginning to come through?

In the streets of America the children are buried
Caught in an avalanche of weapons and drugs
They live and they die in the bowels of a business
That's disguised as a war between The Crips and The Bloods

And there is a need to keep some things a secret
The C.I.A. deals protecting the source
And the government policies directly connecting the drugs and our wars
Does the word justice mean anything to you?

As the battlefield comes home and democracy falls through
I am waiting for the time to come
When the word will be real for everyone
And not just a word but a thing that can be done
But justice must be won

Dr. Feelgood (Demo),Motley Crue,1989,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/motleycrue/drfeelgooddemo.html,"[on re-released disc]

Rat-tailed Jimmy is a second hand hood
He deals out in Hollywood
Got a '65 Chevy, primered flames
Traded for some powdered goods
Jigsaw Jimmy He's runnin' a gang
But I hear he's doin' o.k.
Got a cozy little job, sells the Mexican mob
Packages of candycaine

He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's the one that makes ya feel alright
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood

Cops on the corner always ignore
Somebody's getting paid
Jimmy's got it wired, law's for hire
Got it made in the shade
Got a little hideaway, does business all day
But at night he'll always be found
Selling sugar to the sweet
People on the street
Call this Jimmy's town

He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's the one that makes ya feel alright
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's gonna be your Frankenstein I've got one thing you'll understand
He's not what you'd call a glamorous man
Got one thing that's easily understood
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood

He'll tell you he's the king
Of thes barrio streets
Moving up to shangri-la
Came by his wealth as a matter of luck
Says he never broke no law
Two time loser running out of juice
Time to move out quick
Heard a rumour going round
Jimmy's going down
This time it's gonna stick

He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's the one that makes ya feel alright
He's the one they call Dr. Feelgood
He's gonna be your Frankenstein

Let him soothe your soul, just take his hand
Some people call him an evil man
Let him introduce himself real good
He's the only one they call ""Feelgood""

Free World,Kirsty MacColl,1989,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kirstymaccoll/freeworld.html,"I thought of you when they closed down the school
And the hospital too
Did they think that you were better?
They were wrong
You had so many friends
They all left you in the end
'Cause they couldn't take the patter (stand)

And I'll see you baby when the clans rise again
Women and men united by a struggle (children)
Going down
You've got to walk into the water
With your sister and your daughter
In this free world

If I wore your shades could I share your point of view?
Could I make you feel better?
Paint a picture, write a letter?
Well I know what you're saying
But I see the things you do
And it's much too dangerous
To get closer to you

But I will see you baby when the clans rise again
Women and men united by the struggle
Going down
With a pocketful of plastic
Like a dollar on elastic
In this free world

I'll see you baby when the clans rise again
Women and men united by the struggle
And the ghettoes are full of Mercedes Benz
And you'd never hurt a friend
Who wouldn't tell you

It's cold and it's going to get colder
You may not get much older
You're much too scared of living
And to die is a reliable exit
So you push it and you test it
With 'Thunderbird' and 'Rivin'

And I'll see you baby when the clans rise again
Women and men united in the struggle
In this free world baby
Got to take it got to grab it
Got to get it up and shag it
In this free world

Going down
You've got to get into the water
Like a lamb goes to the slaughter
In this free world baby
Baby going down
With a pocketful of plastic
Like a dollar on elastic

Shopping For Dresses,"Travis, Randy",1990,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/randytravis/shoppingfordresses.html,"Down through the ages men have died for women
And they done so, so many times
Each time I loved one, I always lost one
Seems like the right one is so hard to find.

And, I'm Shopping for dresses with no one to wear them
One in each color, and one in each style.
Maybe someday if I'm lucky
I'll find someday to wear them,
And my shopping will be done for awhile. 

Somewhere a lady's shopping for britches
Comparing the value, and appraising each pair.
Maybe someday the good Lord will bring us together
And we'll both have new wardrobes to wear

I'm shopping for dresses with no one to wear them
One in each color, and one in each style.

Rap Like Me,Too $hort,1990,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/toohort/raplikeme.html,"Too $hort, MC

Rap like me, you'll go straight to the top
Keep doing what you're doing and you're sure to get dropped
Like a trick, nothing's even up my sleeve
A million albums sold and it's hard to believe
Well it's true homeboy, it's not a lie
I used to sell tapes on Sunnyside
I used to catch the 40 bus around the way
Me and Fred Benz, slanging tapes
All these things, that we did
Grab the microphone and start screaming ""Bitch!""
You fronting MC, I hate to cap
You make hit records and you still can't rap
I said it before, I'll say it again
You don't belive me, ask your fans
When I walked into Cali, the place was packed
Sir Too $hort ""Don't stop that rap""
I keep rapping my rhymes, all the time
You got no rhymes, so you listen to mine
I'm not starting a fight, just telling it right
The best damn rapper who ever grabbed the mic
His name is Too $hort, now shut your mouth
In '81 I was rocking the house
I'm a hustler, baby, coming up
I hustle every day and I don't sell drugs
I don't run no gangs, don't shoot no dice
Gave the same damn speech to the Oakland vice
But if you keep pushing, just like you
When they see me on the strip, coming through
I break it down so vicious it'll break your back
With the beat so loud playing Too $hort raps
That's it, I'm set
No need to talk that bullshit
I need a, Oaktown, big time sound
Just enough beat to get on down
So, you other rappers listen to mine
You wouldn't catch Short Dog rapping nursery rhymes
Call my rap trash, jam the junk
Put a sticker on the cover: ""X-Rated Funk""
It's just me, you say I won't go far
But I won't stop rapping cause I rap so hard
From here to New York, back to California
I bumped your girlfriend, don't say I didn't warn ya
All this time you said she's your ho
You really shouldn't give baby all that dough
She gave it all to me cause I fuck so good
I practice on the girls in my neighborhood
Cause when I'm freaky I rap, I spit a rap to a freak
I rarely ever think about a sucker MC
I go platinum, it's just like slapping 'em, bitch
Short Dog in the house, starting some shit
MC's rock and MC's roll
But the albums they make never go gold
When I was young, I knew I'd be one of the best
Every time I made a song it came out so fresh
I was the king of the Oaktown, spitting my game
10 years later, ain't nothing changed
Still the Boss of the Bay, and I know what they say
They call me ""Godfather"" and they call you ""Gay""
Bitch! It's 1990
Your girlfriend's out there trying to find me
She heard about me, I fucked her best friend
I guess she wants to see if I can do it again
You want to be like me, so damn bad
The impossible dream all you MC's had
If you could rap like me, you wouldn't have the dream
Start rapping quit flapping like a chicken wing
If could rap like me, they say you're so great
But when they talk about you, they say you're so fake
And as the days go by, you can't forget
The way I make you feel like shit
MC's like you, I've seen 'em before
You keep on saying ""Fuck Too $hort""
But I'm a better MC than you
And ain't a damn thing you can do, but bitch
On the TV screen, in the magazines
When they interview you, you just make up things
You're on an ego trip and you're fronting like you're down
You're not the first real rapper from the Oakland town
You're just a new jack, and you can't even rap
You wanna trip? Trip on that
I'm like MC Lyte, checking hoes tonight
If you're not a real rapper, get off the mic
Cause with a fake MC, a song's never complete
You'd better learn to rap like me

""Thought you want to be like Too $hort"" [Scratched 2x]

Whenever I rap, you call it noise
I'm tearing up shit up like the Acorn Boys
On 10th street, I got a big freak
Until you learn to speak, realize you're weak
Cause it's the Oaktown, and they all get down
To the rhythm of the Too $hort funky sound
It goes boom, baseline's on ya
Dangerous Crew from Oakland, California
Bitch don't front cause Short Dog is hard
If you answer my rap, I tear your ass apart
Just liket this, it lasts forever
You make a song and I make one better
You say I cuss, I say you're fake
Your eyes pop open like paper plates
You fronting MC, I hate to cap
I make hit records with the vicious raps
I said it before, I'll say it again
The boy ain't nothing but one of my fans
Like silicon titties, can you feel 'em?
How can a fake rapper fuck with a real one?
Shit, I'm that rapping man
I like you like the Klu Klux Klan
Motherfucker want to front on me?
My posse got a real MC, Too $hort
And it don't stop, and it don't stop, and it won't stop
Cause I'm Too $hort baby on the microphone and I'm macking, bitch

""Thought you want to be like Too $hort"" [Scratched 4x]

Now back to the subject, my boy MC
Whatever you say, you can't rap like me
Rappers like me make real hits
Rappers like you talk bullshit
I told my boys there's a new Funky Drummer in town
You're trying to be like James Brown
If I couldn't be me, who would I be?
I damn sure wouldn't be a sucker MC
Cause I'm not like you, my game is true
I pimped these hoes and I pimped you, too
Cause I'm boss, and boss makes the rules
You disobey and you be a fool (Now listen)
One, remember how it all began
Don't guess, the answer is ""Oakland""
Two, you'd better learn to rap like me
Or you like to be a fake MC
Three, never talk down on a player
I wouldn't care if you was Fred Astaire
Last but not least, number four:
Don't ever fuck with Too $hort, bitch

""Thought you want to be like Too $hort"" [Scratched 2x]

Higher Than Hope,Daryl Braithwaite,1990,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/darylbraithwaite/higherthanhope.html,"I remember long ago
Many things we didn't know
But hear me say
We still have time

Too many people
Change the world we live in
They don't know
They'll run out of time

I hear that voice getting stronger
You know that it's higher than hope
We won't have to wait any longer
Stand up and let them know
That you just won't let go

Every stone that's been placed in
The Empire of Ancient grounds
One day they'll fall - you'll say goodbye

United they stand
Today there one land
Nobody knows
Who'll say goodbye

You know that it's higher than hope
We won't have to wait any longer
Stand up and let them know
That you just won't let go

We Never Had It So Good,Tom Robinson,1990,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomrobinson/weneverhaditsogood.html,"If there's one thing that makes me mad
And shed an angry tear
It's teen nostalgia TV ads
For chewing gum and beer
They microwave the distant days
When I was just alive
And serve us up the golden age of 1955

Where all the boys have flat-top hair
And all the girls are slim
They're cute and clean with Levi jeans
And muscles from the gym
They rock and roll to get their kicks
And everyone can drive
There's no-one old or poor or sick in 1955

We never had it so good
We never had it, no we never had it
We never had it so good
We never had it, we never had it at all

Well I remember early nights
And always making do
The Pathe news in black and white
And refugees at school
The whooping cough and polio
The cane to make you cry
With National Service still to go in 1955

We never had it so good
We never had it, no we never had it
We never had it so good
We never had it, we never had it at all

When bubble cars were dream machines
And hair, short back and sides
When sweets were treats and denim jeans

You couldn't steal or buy
American Graffiti, as the servicemen arrived
Was 'Go back home to Hollywood' in 1955

A lovin' face, lovin' smile
And love lights in her eyes

La Patillalera,"Vives, Carlos",1991,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/carlosvives/lapatillalera.html,"Una señora patillalera, 
muy elegante, vestida de negro 
formó en el Valle una gritería 
porque la nieta que más quería 
la pechichona, la consentida, 
un dueño e´ carro cargó con ella.

con mucho esmero y estimación,

Si usted confía en el doctor Molina, 
doña Juana Arias, siento decirle 
que en este caso ha perdido todo. 
Porque ese no afloja su chinchorro 
ni si le dan todos los tesoros 
ni si le dan todo lo que brilla. 
Es eminente y capacitado, 
fuma tabaco y habla de todo, 
y tiene muy buena reputación. 
Fue magistrado con gran decoro, 
Por eso no cambia su chinchorro, 
ni por la silla del gobernador.

ha cometido un error muy grande 
en lo que se ha puesto con Luis Manuel. 
Usted pendiente la policía

Broke out the polish, scrubbed it clean, that dirty machine.
This is your portion, please don't share, the only answer, your only prayer,
Your reflection, please don't stare,
Nothing is going on in... there is your manner,
What you wear, your diseases and your repairs,
All your belongings, please don't share,
Nothing is going on in there.
Update the cleanser, never mind the stain,
We'll take the package, let the contents remain,
Contents remain as yet unnamed.
This is your portion, please don't share,
The only answer, your only prayer,
Your reflection, please don't stare,
Nothing is going on in... there is your manner,
What you wear, your diseases and your repairs,
All your belongings, please don't share,
Nothing is going on in there.
Came home flat busted only to be saved;
Everything comes down to you in a world concave,
World concave, so well behaved,
We still turn on, thirty minutes long, we still turn on.

The Last Payday,"Harry Connick, Jr.",1991,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/harryconnickjr/thelastpayday.html,"Danny was an old-time Bourbon Street barker
Who wanted the same as Charlie Parker
And always cued-up a ball
Thinking he was one rack away
But even when you run the table
The check still seems small
When it's your last payday

The shallow pocket changer
Who always took advantage of strangers
Tried to make a five-grand grab
With a split second getaway
But he forgot that a bag of money
Ain't worth much on a slab
When it's your last payday

That line about luck just can't be bought
You're always lucky 'til you get caught
Trouble will find you, no need to look
And luck won't help when they close the book

I know a lot of young fellas in here
Especially those on the highest tier
Still want to believe
That Santa comes in a sleigh
They're right about the long white beard
But wrong about Christmas Eve
What's Christmas, when it's your last payday

But I won't call your hand

Practiced my moves, rehearsed all my lines
You shut me out, a cold-hearted thing
But it ain't over till the fat lady sings

Now I'm looking so good, how can you resist me
A week from now you'll be sorry that you missed me
For cryin' out loud and for goodness sake 
Tell me now boy, what's it gonna take?

Ever wonder why your daughter looked so sad?

Shot by the cops as she quietly lay
By the side of the creeps she knew...

As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we made

Lifestyles of the poor but proud
Cuddle up on the porch and enjoy the view
We can't afford Niagara Falls
But there's a fountain by the old town hall
We'll make a wish by the light of a lover's moon
I'll get my Grandma's wedding ring
And my brother's Chevrolet
We can stay at your mama's house;
We don't have to go away

To have a hometown honeymoon
Wildflowers and love is in bloom
We'll have a hometown honeymoon
Dancing to the rhythm of love

Your daddy's prize possession
I'll make a good impression
I'm gonna get his blessing

With everything that I can give to you
Wrap my arms around your world

You try to push the truth away
With all your witty repartee
A psychedelic romeo
Who thinks and does it all for show

I see myself in you
I know we're both afraid
There is an emptiness
Behind our masquerade

All I want
Is to wrap my arms around your world
All I want
Is to wrap my arms around your world

Killers,Ice-T,1993,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/icet/killers.html,"A man took an ad on T.V.
To enroll in the police academy
He's very talented, outstanding proof
From his clean-cut appearance to the shine on his boots
When it comes to graduation, he's number one
An expert with a rifal and also a gun
Three weeks on the beat and his weak nerves crack
And fires four warning shots into a kid's back

KILLERS! these are the killers
KILLERS! the coldhearted killers
KILLERS! bloodthirsty killers
KILLERS! beware of the killers

A young girl marries an older man
With more money than you can understand
He smouthers her with pearls and jewelery
And they both seemed as happy as they could be
But three months later, she's sad but content
Seems he had an unexpected accident
The girl said he would be hard to forget
As the papers interviewed her while she flew his jet

KILLERS! these are the killers
KILLERS! she was the killers
KILLERS! the coldhearted killers
KILLERS! beware of the killers

It's time for all to work together for peace
'Cause everybody's doomed if the killings don't cease
Street homicide, war, it's all the same
'Cause murder is murder by any name

An young man loses his only job
To proud to hustle, too honest to rob
He goes to tell his family an his wife
But an argument breaks out, she grabs a knife
Tempers esculate to a total rage
Shots burst out from a loaded twelve-guage
They call it mass murder, suicide
BUT SOMEBODY TELL ME WHY THE KIDS HAD TO DIE

KILLERS! these are the killers
KILLERS! the coldhearted killers
KILLERS! bloodthirsty killers
KILLERS! beware of the killers

Vietnam vet, home from the war
Can't get a job in a candy store
Unemployment hurts and he's living proof
So to take out his frustration, he climbs on the roof
He shows no pity as victims are shot
The only thing to stop him are the bullets from SWAT
Ten people died on a sunny day
BUT TELL ME WHO TAUGHT HIM HOW TO SHOOT THAT WAY

KILLERS! these are the killers
KILLERS! you know the killers
KILLERS! beware of the killers
KILLERS! are you a killer?

It's time for all to work together for peace
'Cause everybody's doomed if the killings don't cease
Street homicide, war, it's all the same
'Cause murder is murder by any name

A known criminal is sentenced to death
Now the legal system controls his last breath
He tries to fight execution with petitions and pleas
And a pardon from the governor is all he needs
He cries out for mercy but nothing's spared
And on his day of termination, he's strapped in a chair
High voltage fills his body in a [?] jail
And all of the people of vengeance grail

KILLERS! the coldhearted killers
KILLERS! bloodthirsty killers
KILLERS! the mercilous killers
KILLERS! are you a killer?

Georgie-Porgie-Pudding-and-pie
Couldn't get a girl, let me tell you all why
He tried to be down like all the rest
Had girls in his hair, gold on his chest
He rolled around town in a coup deville
But he had no money, he was broke as hell
Ladies love money and he needed more
So he tried to steal something out a liquor store
But before Georgie-Porgie could get away
The man pulled out his gun and blew him away

KILLERS! the coldhearted killers
KILLERS! are you a killer?
KILLERS! the mercilous killers
KILLERS! beware of the killers

It's time for all to work together for peace
'Cause everybody's doomed if the killings don't cease
Street homicide, war, it's all the same
'Cause murder is murder by any name

Politicians plan for power each and every day
We are all just puppets in the games they play
They manipulate the message to attain their goals
And for simple re-election they will sell their souls
Nuclear supremacy is the ultimate thrill
So our tax we pay is paid for overkill
[?] up to the skies
WHILE WE ALL PRAY TO GOD THE MISSILES NEVER FLY

KILLERS! these are the killers
KILLERS! they are the killers
KILLERS! are you a killer?
KILLERS! don't be a killer

It's time for all to work together for peace
'Cause everybody's doomed if the killings don't cease
Street homicide, war, it's all the same
'Cause murder is murder by any name

Some mans gonna make an honest woman of my daughter
So it might as well be you
Oh daddy may be poor
But he owns a forty forty
Shotgun wedding
And oh I'm walking up the aisle right now

Here comes the bride singing

Nobody could stop me now oh shotgun, shotgun

A toxic waltz
A factory belches steam
A sidewalk end in baby steps
The widow maker screams

Hear her call your name

The whole world falls apart

See this meeting, hand in hand,

No need to fear this life at all,

Their walls are built with cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on me

Come on along or go alone,
He's come to take his children home

It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he knows
Like the morning sun you come and like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate, barely time to wait
Oh oh all I want to know where does the time go

I live in a silver mine and I call it Beggar's Tomb
I've got me a violin and I beg you call the tune
Any body's choice, I can hear your voice
Oh oh all I want to know how does the song go

Come hear Uncle John's band by the river side
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's band playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

tell me what you see?
(Some muthafuckin' G's)

Roamin' in my muthafuckin' hood and thangs
Seems to me my mutherfuckin' hood done changed
Cause niggas used to kick it with the rival gangs
But now we gots to deal with them survival thangs
.45 in my lap when I'm on the creep
Niggas livin' shife, so I roll one deep
Cause now they see me flippin' in the 1-9-9-4
C.S.I. nigga, black 850
And now they lookin' at me crazy
But off-brand niggas can suck a dick because they can't fade me
And if it came down to the gun, black
I never cracked up on the pressure, cause I was trained for combat
So get yo' muthafuckin' boys together
I represent S.A., nigga, and we makin' noise forever
And gettin' paid at the same time
So you respect a muthafucka when a muthafucka claim mine
Cause if you disrespect, you ass out
And they we rolling through yo' shit in the glasshouse
Actin' bad with the flashers on
Makin' niggas get they asses on
Cause ain't no mutherfuckin' love for fools
Who come around this muthafucka trying to scrub, you fools
It ain't no haps on it, hops
We snaps on the cops
And straps on the glocks
And take the law into our own hands
Cause you ain't fucking with a rookin, nigga, you fucking with a grown man
And we gon' show you what we mean by funk
Muthafucka, you ain't see my trunk
I got a (SK) and a (AK)
And a (12 gauge) that'll fuck a nigga whole day
So recognize a real nigga from the streets
When you rolling through yo' mutherfuckin' hood, what do you see?

Hollerin at my homie at the swisher house
Scope a 40 bag and we hit the spot
Put my shit in park and got up under the tree
Pull the swishers out and gave the ganja to 3
Rapped us up a fattie and we started to smoke
Eyes gettin' red cause we higher than coke
A nigga chillin' cause it's all good
And we ain't trippin' on the bullshit, nigga, because we all hood
But other niggas don't wanna see it that way
But all I got to say is: you don't wanna see that S.A.
Because we're all upon a mission
Killin don't make us no different
And dyin don't make it no different
Cause I done been to mo' wakes in this past year
Than the muthafuckin Bingos lost last year
So ain't no muthafuckin' thang for me
To kill a nigga who ain't fuckin' with the gang with me

Formaldehyde smokin, niggas gettin' loc'ed and
Ready to pull your coat and leave your stomach open
Scoping, hoping for you to fuck up and slip
So we can have a reason for fuckin' up your shit
(It ain't no muthafuckin' peace when they see me)
Cause we never had a muthafuckin' peace treaty
So I know I got to get em with game
And when I hit em with the game I gotta hit em with this damn thang
Cause it's kill or be killed, never cut slack
And if you cut slack, they bust back, fuck that
I never give a second chance to pull the first gun
Cause if they bust one time, that be the worst one
And that's the one that can close the shop
So you gotta stand and hold the glock
Cause in my muthafuckin' hood, that's how it be
But when you're rollin' through your muthafucking hood, what do YOU see?

But the spell of that pretty young girl is far too strong, 
Between her fine perfume and angel face, 
My whole world became another place. 
The dark side of her intelligence was so strong, 
Soon there'll be no difference in right or wrong. 
Next thing I know I had a key that unlocked her door. 
I could not wait to hear the siren song, 
The beginning of the end of my happy home. 
Sailin', sailing 'cross the devil's sea, oooh, hooo, 
too blind in love, too blind to see. 
Heard them say the payback's double-fold, 
Just can't seem to remember who I bought and sold. 
I'll probably still be here when you come around next year, 
Trying to climb from this deep dark hole. 
I'll be damned if I just don't feel I'm growin' old. 
Sailing, sailing 'cross the devil's sea, ohhh, hooo, 
Too blind in love, too blind to see.
Cause she was eviler than evil, slippery like a fox, 
set me up with pain and woe and, I swear it won't seem to stop. 
If I could just remove her hook from deep from within my soul, 
Swear I'll leave and not come back, just let me out that door.

Melting down all metals, tturning plows and sheats to swords

Chailknes and red puddles of those who have been slain
Destiny, that crooked schemer, says the dead shall rise again
Where do we go from here?
And should we really care
The end is finally here
God have mercy
Now we've rewtitten history
The one thing we've found out
Sweet taste of vindication
It turns to ashes in your mouth

If you're fighting to live
It's OK to die!
The answer to your question is...
Welcome to tomorrow!

Where do we go from here?
God have mercy!

Unrelated Thing,They Might Be Giants,1994,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/theymightbegiants/unrelatedthing.html,"Do you smile 'cause I'm funny? said the man
I wasn't joking and I meant the thing I said
Not at all, not at all
Said the woman to the man
I was thinking of an unrelated thing

Unconnected and free
No relationship to anything

How come you never look me in the eye?
Aren't you listening to me said the man
Not at all, not at all
Said the woman to the man
I'm still thinking of an unrelated thing

Somewhere other than here
Something else besides the man

Please explain the expression on your face
Then I'll know what's beneath it said the man
No you won't, no you won't
Said the woman to the man
I'll be thinking of an unrelated thing
I'll be thinking of an unrelated thing

Long Ago,"Carey, Mariah",1995,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mariahcarey/longago.html,"Once upon a time, you whispered softly in my ear
Loving words and fairy tales that I longed to hear
I gave you my body and soul and you took control
As you slowly swept me up and carried me away

You told me pretty lies
As I held onto you tight
You knew how to get your way
Ignorance was bliss in your warm embrace

Long ago, you used to want me
Now it's all so far away (Now it's all so far, so far)
But you still haunt me
And take me back to yesterday

Every now and then I drown in thoughts of yesterday
And the fool's paradise that you blew away
I feel you beside me again and remember when
You came to my window on a dark and stormy day

Baby, I need you now (I need you, baby, right now)
'Cause tonight I'm crumbling down
Sinking in the memories
Shadows of you keep watching over me

Long ago, you used to want me
Now it's all so far away (Now it's all so far)
But you still haunt me
(You still haunt me, you still haunt me, yes you do, baby)
Long ago you used to want me
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me (Haunt me)
Take me back to yesterday

So long ago, so long ago, so long ago
So long ago, so long ago, so long ago
So long ago, so long ago, so long ago

Baby, I need you now (Oh, I need you right now, boy)
'Cause tonight I'm crumbling down
Sinking in the memories
Shadows of you keep washing over me

Long ago, you used to want me
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me
And take me back to yesterday
Long ago, you used to want me
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me
So long ago
Long ago, you used to want me
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me

Deep Down,"Tillis, Pam",1995,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pamtillis/deepdown.html,"You know everyday I walk down memory lane 
Trying to find a way past the same old pain 
Ah you know, but now the message is loud and it's clear 
There ain't no way to get there from here 

Yeah I've finally realized that's the way things are 
I got the bleeding stopped but there's gonna be a scar 
I know I'll go on living but you're always gonna be around 
Deep down, deep down 

Well, I know an old soldier who walks with a limp 
From a war he's still fightin' inside of him 
And just like me he'll go to his grave 
Nursin' a pain that won't go away 

Yeah I've finally realized that's the way things are 
I got the bleeding stopped but there's gonna be a scar 
I know I'll go on living but you're always gonna be around 
Deep down, deep down 

Maybe I really don't wanna be through 
With all the memories I have of you 
We had some bad times but we had good times too

Kiss the world goodbye you see
I'll travel my journey
With a suicide pack
I'll be free

I'm gone 

From the day I was born
I lived my live to the full
Tried everything once
Now I'm ready for more
Now I'm ready for more 

I'll think of my live
The days turn from months, to years
To nothing
I didn't think, I'd have the guts
To go with it
I'll think of my friends
The people I hate and the people
I never got to meet
Hello, goodbye, the best of luck 
I'm gone

So good to see you
But now I'm movin' on
Been good to be here
But it's gone on too long
It's good to see you... So good
To see the back of you

Where you ever misunderstood?
Did anyone say you have to stay?
Think of the happiness you bring
Think of the day you were born 

Remember my family yeah
Keep my habits clean you see
I'll bless the beggar's dog
If god blesses the trees
Stay out of trouble you know
Keep the cream on the cake
Take no ones word for nothing
Thank you goodnight
Best of luck
I'm gone 

From the day I was born... [Etc]

For lasting pleasure

Miles and miles and miles
To find the place
With treasures
Much more rich than gold

For lasting pleasure
With promises
That won't ever break

How many girls
Choose cotton-dress worlds
When they could have satins and lace?
Stand by her man
Through good times and bad
And still keep a smile on her face?

And how many hearts
Could face the winters we've known
And still not turn cold?

Love is a stranger and hearts are in danger
On smooth streets
Paved with gold

True love travels on a gravel road

Down through the years
We've had hard times and tears
But it only makes our love grow
And we'll stay together
No matter how hard the wind blows

Not once have I seen your
Blue eyes fill with envy
Or stray from the warmth
That they hold

On smooth streets paved with gold

A beautiful theme of every dream I ever knew
Down deep in my heart I hear it play
I can feel it start, then it melts away

I hear music when I touch your hand
A beautiful melody from some enchanted land
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say
""Is this the day?""

I alone have heard this lovely strain
I alone have heard this glad refrain
Must it be forever inside of me?
Why can't I let it go? Why can't I let you know?

Why can't I let you know the song my heart would sing?
Beautiful rhapsody of love and youth and spring
The music is sweet, and the words are true
The song is you

Faithfully,Peter Cetera,1995,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/petercetera/faithfully.html,"Some say it's just the nature of the beast
When you love somebody so passionately
Time has a way stealing
That raging fire you're feeling
Leaving the ashes laying at your feet

Those fools of little faith will never know
Those higher places two hearts can go
Where time is standing still
And love will burn until
The heaven and the earth have come and gone

This fire inside for you is constant as the morning star
And you will be forever in my heart
As long as there's a river searching for an endless sea
I will always love you... faithfully

Tonight we'll raise a glass to lovers, across the ages
We'll hold each other and toast to the day
When history (is) said and done and we'll still stand as one
Some things were never meant to fade away

This fire inside for you is constant as the morning star
And you will be forever in my heart
As long as there's a river searching for an endless sea
I will always love you ...faithfully

This fire inside for you is constant as the morning star
And you will be forever in my heart

I Don't Believe A Word,Motorhead,1996,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/motorhead/idontbelieveaword.html,"Don't talk to me, I don't believe a word
Don't try to make me feel alright
All the love in all the world
Is not enough to save my soul tonight
Don't be my friend I'm not a fool
Don't talk of things that we cannot see
When all the ones that sing the blues
Sometimes I think of how it used to be

I have seen the Devil laugh
I have seen God turn his face away
I have nothing left to lose
I have nothing left to say
I have seen the sky turn black
I have seen the seas run dry
I have nothing that is yours
I have nothing now that is not mine

Don't look at me your eyes are cold & hard
Don't wonder that I turn to you
All the grief in all the world
Is not enough to make me comfort you
Don't tell me lies, I'm not a dog,
Don't talk of love it seems to me
All the people that we rob
Sometimes I think of how they used me

I have seen the fires of Hell
I have seen Angels with flaming swords
I have nothing that is mine
I have much that could be yours
I have seen the eye of God
I have heard lies that are true
I have nothing for myself
I have nothing I would give to you

Don't say that word, I know it's only fools
Who do not know their fate is just
All the justice in the world
Is not enough to buy my faith & trust
Don't make that face I won't be pleased
Don't make a sideshow of yourself
All the people we released
Sometimes I think you're someone else

I have been where none have been
In the empty howling rooms
I have everything I need
I have everything you stand to lose
I have seen the diamond worlds
I have seen the shape of space
I have nothing but the world
I have nothing to take its place

Of worlds beyond, of joy and peace

Sleep dissolve and when you rise
May all your dreams be real

The future lies with you my child
My precious golden one
This earth was green and full of hope
But look what we have done

All the battles we have lost
The bridges we have burnt
Sleep dissolve, you'll get across
And still the world will turn

So far away from the shadows we make
Stars that surround you shine bright
Know that I love and when you awake
Bring back a message of light

If I could change the world I knew
The answer will be found
So make your way tonight dissolve
And come back safe and sound
Come back safe and sound

Dreaming Of You,Selena,1997,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/selena/dreamingofyou.html,"Late at night when all the world is sleeping
I stay up and think of you
And I wish on a star that somewhere you are
Thinking of me too

'Cause I'm dreaming of you tonight
'Til tomorrow I'll be holding you tight
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room dreaming about you and me

Wonder if you ever see me
And I wonder if you know I'm there
Am I there? Am I?
If you looked in my eyes
Would you see what's inside
Would you even care?

I just wanna hold you close
But so far all I have are dreams of you
So I wait for the day, wait for the day
And the courage to say
How much I love you
Yes I do!

I'll be dreaming of you tonight
'Til tomorrow I'll be holding you tight
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room dreaming about you and me

Corazón
I can't stop dreaming of you
No puedo dejar de pensar en ti
I can't stop dreaming
Cómo te necesito
I can't stop dreaming of you
Mi amor, cómo te extraño

Late at night when all the world is sleeping
I stay up and think of you
And I still can't believe
That you came up to me
And said, ""I love you.""
I love you too!

Now I'm dreaming with you tonight
'Til tomorrow and for all of my life
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room dreaming with you endlessly

With you tonight
'Til tomorrow
'Til tomorrow I'll be holding you tight
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room
I'll be dreaming of you tonight endlessly
And I'll be holding you tight
'Til tomorrow dreaming endlessly
With you tonight
Endlessly endlessly dreaming

All That I Bleed (Acoustic),Savatage,1997,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/savatage/allthatibleedacoustic.html,"Someone
Got themselves a letter
In the mail the other day
It's already worn and tattered
And I guess
It gives away

All the things we keep inside
All the things that really matter
The face puts on its best disguise
And all is well
Until the heart
Betrays

She knows
As she reads the letter
That things were bound to stray
Winds blow
She pulls her coat tighter
And the letter flies away

With all the things she keeps inside
All the things that really matter
The face puts on its best disguise
And all is well
Until the heart betrays

Lord bring on the night
Wrap it all around me
Let it hold me tight
Soak up all that I bleed

Lord bring on the night
Wrap it all around me
Let it hold me tight
Soak up all that I bleed

And I'll fly away
Yeah I'll fly away
Oh ho, I'll fly away
Watch me, yeah yeah

Lord bring on the night
Wrap it all around me
Let it hold me tight
Soak up all that I bleed
I bleed

My Big Mouth,Oasis,1997,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/oasis/mybigmouth.html,"Everybody knows but no one's saying nothing
It was a sound so very loud but no one can hear
I got something in my shoes it's keeping me from walking
Down the long and winding road back home to you

And round this town, you've ceased to be
That's what you get for sleeping with the enemy
Where angels fly you won't play
So guess who's going to take the blame for

My big mouth, my big name
I'll put on my shoes while I'm walking
Slowly down the hall of fame
Into my big mouth, you could fly a plane
I'll put on my shoes while I'm walking
Slowly down the hall of fame
Slowly down the hall of fame

I ain't never spoke to God
And I ain't never been to Heaven
But you assumed I knew the way
Even though the map was given
And as you look into the eyes
Of a bloody cold assassin
It's only then you'll realize
With whose life you have been messing

And round this town, you've ceased to be
That's what you get for sleeping with the enemy
Where angels fly you won't play
So guess who's going to take the blame for

My big mouth, my big name
I'll put on my shoes while I'm walking
Slowly down the hall of fame
Into my big mouth, you could fly a plane
I'll put on my shoes while I'm walking
Slowly down the hall of fame

We Can't Unmake Love,"Judd, Wynonna",1997,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/wynonnajudd/wecantunmakelove.html,"Before God and family we made the perfect start
And swore death would be the only thing to keep us apart
But we're fighting just like soldiers on a field of battle now
And the life we made together is our only common ground
She's got your eyes, my nose and our hearts

[Chorus]

We can't unmake love
And just erase all the years
The sweetest little girl
In all the world will still be here
We promised love would last
She's living proof it still does
So even if we wanted to give up
We can't unmake love

Remember how the future looked as we'd lie awake and dream
Thinking just how powerful the love we made could be
And I can't help believing it's all still possible
But if coming to our senses is gonna take a miracle
She's right upstairs, right now, asleep

A Room For Everything,10000 Maniacs,1997,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/10000maniacs/aroomforeverything.html,"You were looking away from me, western skies calling you. 
Colors spilling, running dazzling you. 
I was looking the other way, voices call from the east, 
I saw my roots of the trees there planted at my feet. 
It could be I'm searching for a place so small with room for everything 
where worlds on worlds revolve. 
But how can we wait? I wouldn't hold you back. 
Suppose I was the clever one and words came easy to me. 
I could say I was writing a song about you and me. 
Maybe that verse is yet to be found, but waits inside of me, 
a secret room a tangled web to unweave. 
But how can we wait knowing our ways, how can we hold on, 
still you know it's not too late.

Of Pain,Eighteen Visions,1997,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eighteenvisions/ofpain.html,"I stare down your blood coated throat glancing back into what was daylight.
It shines on your dismembered body as vengeance drips from my hand.
Paint your walls with dead flesh.
Watch it rot. let it stain.
A whore to your project, they suffer in shackles of human exploitation.
Chain of blood see it sleep.
Rusty knife to apparatus.
Sweat glazed palms.
Eyes glisten with fear.
Bleed these scars you bear
And let me piss on your open wounds.
Slip struggle to your feet.
Choke on the wretched stench of a whorehouse and let the innocent cry.
No more excuses now its your time to die.

Drive you insane

Protect your soul

Help Me Understand,Hank Williams,1998,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/hankwilliams/helpmeunderstand.html,"[CHORUS]
[SUNG]
A  little girl prayed at the close of the day, 
Cause her daddy had gone far away,
On her little face was a look of despair,
I stood there and listened, and I heard this prayer
My mommie says daddy has brought us to shame
And I'm never no more to mention his name
Lord take me and lead me and hold to my hand
Oh heavenly Father help me understand

[RECITATION]
You know friends I wonder--
Just how many homes are broken tonight
And just how many tears are shed 
By some little word of anger
That never should have been said

I'd like to tell you a story 
Of a family I once knew.
We'll call them Mary and William 
And their little daughter Sue

Now Mary was just a plain mother
And Bill was just a usual dad
And they had their little family quarrels 
(like everybody else)
But neither one really got mad

Then one day something happened 
It was nothing of course
But one word led to another 
And the last word led to a divorce

Now here were two grown up people
Who failed to use common sense
They strengthened their own selfish pride 
At little Sue's expense

You know she didn't ask to be brought to 
this world
To drift from pillar to post
But a divorce never stops to consider
The ones it hurts the most

There's be a lot more honest loving 
In this wicked ole world today
If just a few parted parents
Could hear little Sue say

[SUNG]
Take me and lead me and hold to my hand
Oh heavenly Father, help me understand

Eliminate detection
As well as rhyme or reason
We always aim to please them
And my thoughts begin to roam

Up the windows and lock the door 

Persist to resist, fight back 
Not with a fist, with tact 
Ideas in action, with passion 
Passion commitment, dedication 

When all is said and done, our time is spent 
And we've had our fun 
Have you taken the time to think about your life 
And what it means to know eternity 

I've dwelt long on the past and I just can't

I struggle in vain at last, I've managed to board 
Up the windows and lock the door

Patient Hope In New Snow,Bright Eyes,1998,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brighteyes/patienthopeinnewsnow.html,"The heat comes in distant shifts to fill up my room
It spills out of these ancient vents to meet the new cold
And I lay in my twisted sheets and stare out at the snow
Still thinking of the next few months, my cold and lifeless eyes
I've never felt so separate
And then there's you but that's so obvious
It's hopeless and I know this, that's why I can't dream
No desire or circumstance would keep this from me
One by one, to department stores
We walk through the aisles
In a forest of designer clothes, you touch me and smile
And for a moment I could want nothing
Your bright eyes burn through my exploding heart
And we stand as the shoppers pass us
And for once I can feel a touch complete
And I need to just be near you and fill these empty eyes
But you start turning as resistance pulls you from my cold and boring life
Let's make this easy and let time pass, as devotion dies,
The list goes on and on
I have waited and I will be waiting for the pain to cure the fear

You know wassam dog
Bitches ain't gon' like this here, ya heard me?
They ain't gon' like, you know what I'm sayin'?
Fuck 'em

From what I was told niggaz say I'm a hit No Limit like Pac
Hit Death Row and make some money out the asshole
And blow, up like the world trade
And be protected by No Limit tanks, soldiers with K's and hand grenades

Could you recall a soulja that used to be crawlin'
Now I'm ballin', don't plan on fallin'
For the world
Left the furl in the dope man, on the set
Cause I got plans bigger then the Desire Projects
I run with steel object tottin', niggaz that smoke poten
Watchin me and they backs scopin'
Outta all soldier haters
Quick Draw McGraw niggaz see ya later
Cradle to the grave ya
Ya daddy made ya?
Let's see if he can be ya savior
When I cave ya chest in with me murder weapon
They can't find nare Smith and Wesson
Only glocks and street machines with infer beams
You know what I mean
Fully automatic things light up the scene
And break him like Carl Lewis
Nothin but gun smoke is all ya smell
Niggaz lying dead on bullets and shells
My people dwells through Uptown
Where the shit goes down
Shot callers and big ballers, mothers know
And do-do brown, Beats By The Pound, somethin' you could smoke too
Flavors like jambalya, red beans, rice, gumbo, and stew
My little one said its all on you in Chopper City
Run up on ya clique clan, and posse
Ain't no stoppin', my committe
Shits bigger then me, Nino Black
And a can of Trinity, ya feelin' me?

From what I was told niggaz say I'm a hit No Limit like Pac
Hit Death Row and make some money out the asshole
And blow, up like the world trade
And be protected by No Limit tanks, soldiers with K's and hand grenades

Incarceration had me real impatient
I was local until ya heard me on Down South Hustlers, it was nation
That told this shit is my creation
Is it real, yeah, cause niggaz wearin' soldier rags and shit
Keepin' it trill
My reservation is to make some mills
And stay independent
Stay wearin' girbauds and polos, and soldier Reebok tennis
Crushed out tank on my neck
Protect my chest like a vest
No more coke, no more dope, just alcohol and sex
Respect my rhyme because my mind is filled up with anger
Sumthn like a glock 40
With black italian bullets in the chamber
Wait to be released and decease fake ass MC's
Niggaz best freeze cause I squeeze gats and burn to the third degree
Make you wonder will you ever breathe again like Toni Braxton
Leave ya skull fraction, about more action than Jackson
So you better ask somebody that know me
If they real they gon' tell ya whats real
If they fake they gon' soldier hate
I can freestyle about it without makin' no mistake, ask Trey
That's my compadre, a nigga that I ride with, all day
Got a cocked K in the trunk
Bumpin' nothin' but the Beats By The Pound funk
Full of that skunk, got the windows fogged up
And the system all the way pumped
Everything we drop be fire, don't nothin' be bunk

From what I was told niggaz say I'm a hit No Limit like Pac
Hit Death Row and make some money out the asshole
And blow, up like the world trade
And be protected by No Limit tanks, soldiers with K's and hand grenades

I was a weed fiend, dope fiend and coke fiend with low key
And I was on the come up move, with UNLV
Used to rock the club 49
Back in 93
Hoes was givin' me love
Niggaz givin' me daps and hugs
Soldiers respect soldiers, and soldiers respect thugs
Thugs gotta respect soldiers, if them don't want they life to be over
Brought to a closin'
Ain't nothin' changed but the name
When ya say soldier
Mean magnolia
Ya got that?
And me keep me glock 40 cocked back
Hoes jock that, when a nigga be all the way real
Only thing they want is the dope dick appeal
But I don't fuck around no more
And only saw me like that ol' clown ass hoe
If my flow was a gun, bitch you would run
When you hear my come, from the head
Every lyric is a bullet
Fuckin' ya up with some of this shit I say
In 95 nigga left for me dead but I didn't die
And some of the soldiers die
They only multiply
God left me alive, so I can blow up in the world
I thank the man every night for takin' me off that furly girl
It gave me the opportunity to raise my son and my community
Cause now a days niggaz got guns and shit
Screamin' out unity
Motherfuckin' nigga bruisin' me
That something I can't go for
I done signed the contract
Shut the studio door

Dreams Of The San Joaquin,Linda Ronstadt,1998,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lindaronstadt/dreamsofthesanjoaquin.html,"I'm sending you some money
I wish it could be more
But it's harder than I thought
To find the work I came here for

This place is just as pretty
As I pictured it to be
But a man in need of work's
An all too common sight to see

Each morning as the trucks roll in
A lucky few climb on
And the rest of us are left to wonder
Where the dream has gone
Where the dream has gone

They say the Sierra melts with the rain
To race through the valley like blood through the vein
Turning the lowland from golden to green
To harvest forever the dreams of the San Joaquin

Every day I struggle
With the distance and the fear
That I will not return
Or find a way to bring you here

My emptiness grows deeper
I feel my spirit fall
As night comes like a blanket
It brings no sleep at all

I only hope that time will find
A way to work things out
We will be together
In the life we dream about
Life we dream about

They say the Sierra melts with the rain
To race through the valley like blood through the vein
Turning the lowland from golden to green
To harvest forever the dreams of the San Joaquin
We'll harvest forever the dreams of the San Joaquin

I used to look down on all that mess
Seems like everything just changed
Once I gave my love to you you went away
Since you are the one to blame
You better figure out how to get it back baby

[Chorus]

Before I met you I didn't think
That you'd ever do a thing
To take away my independence baby
Before I met you I was straight
Now I'm bout to go insane
I saw you and I think about you baby

The Sun Goes Down And The World Goes Dancing,"Magnetic Fields, The",1999,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/magneticfields/thesungoesdownandtheworldgoesdancing.html,"So the sun goes down and the world goes dancing
And the stars come out and they all go dancing
And there is nothing I'd like more
Than a twirl across this rickety old floor

Well I don't know why but I just feel like dancing
I can't imagine why but I feel like dancing
And there is nothing in this world
That I'd like better than a twirl across your rickety old floor

Maybe it's you
You know your eyes are awful blue
Maybe it's more
Maybe you're all I ever waited for
After all the endless nights when I wished I could still cry

It Takes Love,Grits,1999,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/grits/ittakeslove.html,"Still waters run deep
Muddy waters won't keep

Love, love, it takes love
More than love is God above
Heaven knows it's not enough
Cause this thing can be so rough
Tried and true when I keep my eyes on you
Cause still waters will run deep if, in you, my faith I keep
This thing called love

I used to occasionally try my hand relationally
Obsessive with the outside appearance and what I saw facially
What I had to have, have just didn't add up
Amount to much of what was revealed
Seeing past they looks and such
The baggage piled up, revealing shine through
Feathers riled up
Emotions rev like a engine, engine, then they drive up
Soon she jet
I shoot for the exit myself
A quick outro and I'm lost for words, like Gwyneth Paltrow, (who'll be my soul mate?)
Muster up change for the toll gate
The life I was chasing when real
I used to roll fate with this outtake
The right thing, I always did last
And, like an outbreak, everything caught up with me too fast
They can't stop me
Come out pure as gold and do my fold
Dismiss the latter, then I embrace the promise told
I receive it and, with Christ like faith, I believe it
Predestined, manifested
I water the seed and test it

Love, love, it takes love, (still waters run deep)
More than love is God above
Heaven knows it's not enough, (muddy waters won't keep)
Cause this thing can be so rough
Tried and true when I keep my eyes on you, (making sure my thing is right)
Cause still waters will run deep if, in you, my faith I keep, (we'll start a secret comes to life)
This thing called love

As the sun rises daily, I'm awakened
How do I begin, dealing with the past guilty of sin?
Though I know I'm not enslaved by his power
Deep inside, my soul is free, but my mind reflects time and time again
Frustration got me burning from degrees of separation, cause my deeds put a distance in between the close relation with my children
In physical sense, contact is limited to often as possible
Visits and phone conversations
Face the fact: I know I'm only part of half of the blame
But, in full, I feel the same
And at present it's not the same s when I was there to give them names
And my presence was felt to save the claim that I was daddy
So often I feel sadness of the outcome of the madness with me and mama
Now we all face the drama through faith in God for healing
Yes, this price I must pay
Not a day goes by I don't envision your faces
Please forgive me

Love, love, it takes love, (still waters run deep)
More than love is God above
Heaven knows it's not enough, (muddy waters won't keep)
Cause this thing can be so rough
Tried and true when I keep my eyes on you, (making sure my thing is right)
Cause still waters will run deep if, in you, my faith I keep, (we'll start a secret comes to life)
This thing called love, love, it takes love, (still waters run deep)
More than love is God above
Heaven knows it's not enough, (muddy waters won't keep)
Cause this thing can be so rough
Tried and true when I keep my eyes on you, (making sure my thing is right)
Cause still waters will run deep if, in you, my faith I keep, (we'll start a secret comes to life)

Morning Star,Fastball,2000,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fastball/morningstar.html,"As I wake I see a morning star
Through the window dimly shines
Its final statement at the closing of the night
I've got a few more minutes of night time before I rise

As the dawn is breaking up the darkness
The morning star will fade but never die

Morning star, I can't see your face no more and that's good
Get out now, out on the streets of your nowhere neighborhood

As I laid down last night I felt no pain
The day went on without a sound
Another night to put all the busyness away
I had a few more hours of night time before I'd rise

All the stars were out last night in the sky
I slept right through as they all went by
Soon the dawn was breaking up the darkness
The morning star will fade but never die

Morning star, I can't see your face no more and that's good
Get out now, out on the streets of your nowhere neighborhood
You come along with a color that I can't match
Gold chain and a crystal ball attached
You're coming from the wrong direction

And as I sleep tonight I'll dream of you
Sleeping somewhere far away
You come into my head so pretty and so true
I get a few more hours to dream of you till I rise

As the fireworks shoot off in the sky
I sleep right through as it all goes by
Soon the darkness would suck up into the dawn
The morning star will fade but never die

Morning star, I can't see your face no more and that's good
Get out now, out on the streets of your nowhere neighborhood
You come along with a code that I can't crack
Gold chain and a crystal ball attached
You were coming from the wrong direction
I was going in the wrong direction
I was going in the wrong direction

Amor Con Amor Se Paga,"Aguilar, Pepe",2000,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pepeaguilar/amorconamorsepaga.html,"Por tu culpa mujer, por tu culpa
Éste amor que te tengo divaga
Lo rompiste por ser insoluta
Y por eso la pena me embriaga

Prometiste que nada ni nadie
Este amor de los dos rompería
Fuiste puerta sin chapa ni llave
A pesar que me diste la mía

Y amor con amor se paga
Y algun día te cobraré
Si hoy tu traición me amarga
Como hombre me aguantaré

Pero anda con mucho tiento
Y mira por donde vas
Que las heridas que siento
Con otro las pagarás

Despacito te entraste en mi alma
Como se entra en la carne una daga
Me rompiste mi vida y mi calma
Pero amor con amores se paga

Andarás por veredas ajenas
Y tendrás mucho más que conmigo
Pero el mundo esta lleno de penas
Y esas pena serán tu castigo

Y amor con amor se paga...

Pero anda con mucho tiento...

A Thousand Kisses Deep,Leonard Cohen,2001,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardcohen/athousandkissesdeep.html,"The ponies run, the girls are young,
The odds are there to beat.
You win a while, and then it’s done –
Your little winning streak.
And summoned now to deal
With your invincible defeat,
You live your life as if it’s real,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

I’m turning tricks, I’m getting fixed,
I’m back on Boogie Street.
You lose your grip, and then you slip
Into the Masterpiece.
And maybe I had miles to drive,
And promises to keep:
You ditch it all to stay alive,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

And sometimes when the night is slow,
The wretched and the meek,
We gather up our hearts and go,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

Confined to sex, we pressed against
The limits of the sea:
I saw there were no oceans left
For scavengers like me.
I made it to the forward deck.
I blessed our remnant fleet –
And then consented to be wrecked,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

I’m turning tricks, I’m getting fixed,
I’m back on Boogie Street.
I guess they won’t exchange the gifts
That you were meant to keep.
And quiet is the thought of you,
The file on you complete,
Except what we forgot to do,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

And sometimes when the night is slow,
The wretched and the meek,
We gather up our hearts and go,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

I'm talking head to toe, and she ain't nothing but fun
Watch yourself oh Lord, there she go here she come

Step in the club and, baby girl be stunting
Legs thighs hips, nigga she the one

Pushing yo back, all into the wall girl
I ball girl, until I'm bout to fall girl
And you ain't even ready, to handle this log girl
I mean, it's like a heavy piece of wood in your weed gripper
You can call me Moby Dick, and I'ma be Flipper
Talk shit, make this motherfucking heat get ya
If you think, I got some petty ass beef wit ya
Fake pimp ass busters, them try to handcuff
Baby bring that money to me, but make sure you answer
Your telephone, tell them broke niggaz they better gone
Leave you alone, pimp tight MJG make em

Just a natural born pro, keep you begging for mo'

Got's to be a real playa, wanna get in them pants

Back to back like Shaq, and the Lakers
Watch her show out, when she hit the spot
Got her touching on herself, cause the X is hot
She's a (cowgirl), and she calling the shots
Like I turn around and look, when she working the twat
Got a lovely face, and a sexy waist
A earring on her navel, I'ma catch me a case

Get your groove on, you see some playas you want
Then get your choose on, cause you know it go down

You will fall to your knees dead
Or begging quarter
Torn to shreds by obese vultures
Fossilized in the desert sand
We are the breath of horus
Hot as the desert wind
We are the slayers and reapers of men
You will never escape
This valley gallala
Left to decompose
Forbidden the underwolrd
Bemused by battle lust
I gash your throat
And splatter your blood
Upon the altar of Bes
We erect one hundred pyramids
Weth your severed heads

Merry Go Round,Mary Gauthier,2002,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/marygauthier/merrygoround.html,"From the painful rays of daybreak
Ripping darkness out your eyes
To every kiss with bourbon breath
Your daddy didn't hide, he didn't hide

From the crack of his backhand slap
To your mama's blue veined hands
That held her rosary desperately
'Cause she didn't understand
From the brokenhearted playground
In the lonely afternoon
To the violence of little boys
And the crying in your bedroom

Till the wind blows right through you and rain don't get you wet
Till your lips move constantly but you ain't said nothing yet
Till you ride that horse in circles going up and coming down
Round and round, it's a merry go round

From the bitter tears of helplessness
Falling from your grandma's face
As they strap you to the stretcher
While she quickly packs your suitcase
From the money that you stole from her
On the day she died
To the long lines at the clinic
Waiting for a days supply, a days supply

Till the wind blows right through you and rain don't get you wet
Till your lips move constantly but you ain't said nothing yet
Till you ride that horse in circles going up and coming down
Round and round, it's a merry go round

From the phone booth on the freeway
When there's no one left to call
To the porcelain Cod you pray to
In the public restroom stall
From the milky white of heroin
As it bubbles and it sooths
To the dirty sheets you lie on

Re-Birth,AZ,2002,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/az/rebirth.html,"I'm back first and foremost; I'd like to thank Nas
For allowing me to have be on the Illmatic, and that Stillmatic Joint
Changed the game a whole lot, secondly I'd like to thank the Notorious B.I.G.
Who put Brooklyn on the map, you the revolution of that era
And all the artists that came after the era we started
I'd like to Thank the East Coast, West, the North, Dirty dirty
This is my story, welcome me back

For all those I still speak to guess we still peoples'
Life's more peaceful when you low and you eating legal
Certain niggas never spoke now it's peace to see you
It's a different side 'cuz it's the streets too, pleased to meet you
Just think I was a thief and kieful
Sold coke even dabbled in a bit of diesel
Scare ridded saw the light and I slid wit it, left the life
But for the price I can live wit it we all pawn
Know a few niggas that's coming home
Could see 'em now in that '86 summer zone
Hope they adapt, whatever led niggas to smoking cracks
Knew a few that went too far for me to coach 'em back
What a waste, this little blood niggas'll cut ya face
Catching a case'll make you fuck around and touch your safe
This all I know, intelligence is all I show
I'm from the roots and the truth is that I love the doe, welcome me Back huh

You attract some of the baddest when you platinum status
That's why I stay with prophylactics after what happened to Magic
Six days of my creation had to relax on the Sabbath
Remember asking certain niggas to past me a package
I was blind moving ass backwards
But you can bet it was the grind that made the cash massive
Back on my feet, accapella used rap to no beats
On the run, dun, was the first one to clap at police
I ever saw, can never catch me in the presents of flaws
Push the Accord in '94, Mack11 in the board
Who wanna bring it? Since Nas, niggas swore I was Queensbridge
That's surprising from the wise I was taught to be lenient
Move in silence, my moms claimed my music was violent
Had to school her, let her know that I'm a user of talents
Many faces, Gucci sneakers with the skinny laces
Fendi sweats and Begets all up in the bracelets

To my own time role your own innocence by.
Grab on to my sleeve the one that grabs at your ankle.
Debate to understand that we all have a flaw.
Then fail to represent your life as you know it.
God grant you one wish to turn back the time. 
Correct and create, making sense of...

Me and my star, Matthew good night.
You know by law, when you'll be forgiven.
Maria my star, Matthew good night
You know my Lord, when you'll be forgiven.

So they pulled your confidence down with those verbal discrepancies.
Now and then you'll gain what they've lost through a challenge of unpronounced.
Pain is only a pulse if you just stop feeling it.
You might be able to use the very thing that makes us up.

Me and my star, Matthew good night.
You know by law, when you'll be forgiven.
Maria my star, Matthew good night
You know my Lord

Wait, now, here when will you believe?
Me, I'm merely asking you to help me.
When did I say to murder?
Wait, now, here. Please hear me out.
Time consumer, time consuming, consume me.
Down, and out.

Hardly A Mountain,Big Country,2002,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bigcountry/hardlyamountain.html,"She still dreams about their time together
Wide awake in the dark morning hours
It was never gonna be forever
Moments fade like a lover’s past

And she rises to get through the morning
Doesn’t dress until the afternoon
What’s the use of it when no one’s calling
She wouldn’t want to come far too soon

No, there’s hardly a mountain that I would not climb
A sea I would not swim
No, there is not a river that I would not cross
To be with you again

No, there’s hardly a mountain that I would not climb
A sea I would not swim
No, there is not a river that I would not cross
To be with you again

He likes to say he is too busy to worry
Then it’s with him out on his own
They can’t help that everything is a hurry
He’s in safer hands when he’s alone

But in the quiet of an endless evening
Too much time to think, too much to fill
He still dreams about their time together
We come and go like we always will

And there’s hardly a mountain that I would not climb
A sea I would not swim
No, there is not a river that I would not cross
To be with you again

No, there’s hardly a mountain that I would not climb
A sea I would not swim
There is not a river that I would not cross
To be with you again

No, there’s hardly a mountain that I would not climb
A sea I would not swim
No, there is not a river that I would not cross

There’s hardly a mountain that I would not climb

As We Wept,Demon Hunter,2002,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/demonhunter/aswewept.html,"I will stand and fight to justify you.
You have bled and died to justify me.
Force me down into hate.
Your freedom will stop when I can't breath.
I'm taking the path that I don't need.
I'm taking the place so it won't bleed.
Broken out and turned away.
Burned to the ground and change the face.
Bled to death and turned to gray.
Resurrect again to say.
I made my promise, and now I've fallen.
Through broken pieces I set you.
I will stand and fight to justify you.
You have bled and died to justify me.
Let me see it all die in front of myself so I can't lie.
A hollow design for the new side.
Exterior death for the old side.
This is the end of the last time.
Bury the old and say the name.
Break the mold and new remain.
Resurrect again to say.
I made my promise, and now I've fallen.
Through broken pieces I see you.
I will stand and fight to justify you.
You have bled and died to justify me.
A lifeless body, a broken soul.
I fall to zero, I've lost control.
I've lost control, I will stand and fight to justify you.
You have bled and died to justify me.

7 Ways To Sunday,"Mighty Mighty Bosstones, The",2002,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mightymightybosstones/7waystosunday.html,"Seven ways to Sunday
Seven separate ways to Sunday
But he did not know which one would save him
So he had to try every code and combination
On the road to his salvation
There were no two ways about it
He had seven ways to try
With seven ways to test
He vowed that he would not rest
And there was nothing up above
So he put everything aside
He had so much invested
He probably should have rested
Seven ways he swore that every last one would be tried
What he was looking for is not much more
Than what we all are looking for
But nowadays it seems like there is precious little of
He looked high and he looked low
And there was nothing up above
He had to try all seven
So he tried them to high-heaven
From one end to the other
And then he turned around
He was thoroughly exhausted
And his faith had been accosted
He tried seven ways and wondered
Why it was he hadn't found
What he was looking for is not much more
Then what we all are looking for
But nowadays it seems like there is precious little of
Desperate and alone
He turned over every stone
He tried seven ways to Sunday
He was looking for love
He looked high and he looked low
And there was nothing up above
He'd been told where he could go
What he was looking for was love
He looked high and he looked low
And there was nothing up above
He looked high and he looked low
And there was nothing up above
He was told where he could go

Moving Oleta,Reba McEntire,2003,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rebamcentire/movingoleta.html,"Moving Oleta was the hardest thing he'd done
The nurse's saw an old woman crying, but he saw the love of his life
She don't know where she is, but she knows this isn't home
Love is a hard, hard road

He met her in the summer of '37
In a brush harbor down on the Rush Creek shore
He loved her black hair and the mischief in her smile
But she won him with her eyes
All the years and children grow
He still sees her the same
Love is a hard, hard road

He woke up each morning and drove into town
He stayed all day 'till her dinner came
Then he took her to her room, leaned on her wheelchair like a walker
And covered her with a quit that she made
Only God and a couple of nurses helped the old man shoulder the road
Love is a hard, hard road

And he said
They tell me this is all that's left
Say this hell on earth is best
I list all those reasons and I still don't understand it
He cursed his body old and weak
Tears of failure burned his cheek
And he said
Oh, don't you know I prayed to die before this day
Love is a hard, hard road

There's a shadow much darker than the valley of death
When you fear the reaper might not come today
They line 'em up in La-z-boys out in the sunroom
The TV keeps the quiet away
She can't recall his name
And she's the only love he's known
Love is a hard, hard road
Love is a hard road

Moving Oleta was the hardest thing he'd done

Dry Bones,"Handsome Family, The",2003,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/handsomefamily/drybones.html,"Old Enoch, he lived to be
Three-hundred and sixty-five
When the lord came and took him
Back to heaven alive

I saw, I saw the light come shining
Shining all around
I saw the light come shining
I saw the light come down

When Paul prayed in prison
Those prison walls fell down
Prison keeper shouted
Redeeming love I've found

I saw, I saw the light come shining
Shining all around
I saw that light come shining
I saw that light come down

When Moses saw that burning bush
He walked it 'round and 'round
And the lord said to Moses
You's treading holy ground

I saw, I saw the light come shining
Shining all around
I saw the light come shining
I saw the light come down

Dry bones in that valley
Got up and took a little walk
The deaf could hear
And the dumb could talk

I saw, I saw the light come shining
Shining all around
I saw the light come shining
I saw the light come down

Adam and Eve in the garden
Under that sycamore tree
Eve said to Adam
Satan never tempted me

I saw, I saw the light come shining
Shining all around
I saw the light come shining
I saw the light come down

Something's Missing,John Mayer,2003,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnmayer/somethingsmissing.html,"I'm not alone, I wish I was.
Cause then I'd know, I was down because
I couldn't find, a friend around
To love me like, they do right now.
They do right now.

I'm dizzy from the shopping malls
I searched for joy, but I bought it all
It doesn't help the hunger pains
and a thirst I'd have to drown first to ever satiate

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
something's missing
And I don't know what it is
At all

When autumn comes, it doesnt ask. 
It just walks in, where it left you last.
And you never know, when it starts
Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart:

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
something's missing
And I don't know what it is
At all

I can't be sure that this state of mind, is not of my own design
I wish there was an over the counter test, for loneliness.
For loneliness like this.

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is
Something's different
And i don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is

Time To Go Inward,"Crowell, Rodney",2003,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rodneycrowell/timetogoinward.html,"It's time to go inward take a look at myself
Time to make the most of the time that I've got left
Prison bars imagined are no less solid steel

Time to go inward would you believe that I'm afraid
To stare down the barrel of the choices that I've made
The ghost of bad decisions make mountains out of everything I feel

Outside my window the wind weaves a path through the trees
The moon takes a shine to the shadows that fall on the leaves

It's time to go inward hmmmmm
I don't know if I can do it after all that I've become
I've been a fool for money but it's vanity that always leaves me flat

It's time to go inward man I hope I have the nerve
To take an inventory of the causes that I serve
They say a man without a conscience is like a man without a country or something like that

It's time to go inward time to be still
If I don't do it now I don't believe I ever will
My mind is like a chatterbox whose noise pollutes the pathways to my soul

Time to go inward time to get a grip
Time to put an end to one long bad acid trip
I'm all out of excuses now for the way I've let my choices take a toll

Jesus and Buddah and Krishna and Minnie Pearl knew
To do unto other the things you want done unto you

It's time to go inward and take a look at me
Try to make some sense of life's illusions that I see
And try to solve the riddle of what it is I have to offer to this world

As slowly I pull through
And I cannot reach the world today
'Cause I'm suffering from you
And the more I think, the more I cry
As I walk away from you

I'm two steps away
From loneliness
I'm awake
From the mess we made
I'm alive
And I'm feeling incomplete

I don't understand my life
Or the version that chose you
And the warring hearts and winter came
Now there's nothing left to do
And I cannot reach the world today
'Cause I'm suffering from two
And the more I think, the more we die
As I walk away from you

I'm two steps away
I'm two steps away
I'm two steps away
I'm two steps away

Two steps away
Two steps away
From loneliness
I'm awake
From the mess we made
I'm alive

Two steps away
Two steps away
Two steps away

I can't remember, but how can my memories leave me? I can't believe the spirts would try to deceive me But they did, just like a little kid I was so eager to learn, so willing to give But all they did was hate me, and break me Use my body for a host and my mirror for the gateway 

Something is wrong with me, I can't be who I need to be Something is wrong with me, will it last for eternity? Something is wrong with me, I can't be who I need to be Something is wrong with me, will it last for eternity? 

Please don't walk away I want you to hear what I got to say I never had anyone ever care for me I never had anyone ever there for me If you would listen to me instead of calling me names I would I could explain why I'm shaking and why I'm going insane My mind is on vacation, lack of conversation I'm like a radio, with static on every station Still I wanna know, will I be normal again? You say it's bullshit and tell me that it's all pretend But if it's false, then why don't the demons just disappear? And if it's untrue, then why am I seeing them crystal clear? Because I do, the mirror's turning blue And soul after soul keeps walking right through They're living in my house and living inside my head Some sleep inside the closet, others sleep under the bed

Se Te Hizo Tarde,Felipe Pelaez,2005,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/felipepelaez/setehizotarde.html,"Pienso que se te hizo tarde
Para decirme que me quieres
Para decirme que hoy que amas
Si ayer mataste un gran amor
O es que no recuerdas mi alma triste llorando
Cuando me decías que me alejara
Que lo que querías no era yo
Cuantas veces yo esperaba y
No llegaba un te amo
Cuantas veces yo quedaba
Con las ganas de un beso
Cuantas veces yo esperaba
Que me dieras la mano
Cuanto tiempo yo ocultaba
En soledad mi tormento

Y eso no lo sabes tú
Y eso tú no lo sabes
Que mientras jugabas al amor, mi amor
Yo me iba olvidando de ti

Se te hizo, se te hizo tarde
Pa valorar mis sentimientos
Se te hizo, se te hizo tarde
Para llevarte aquí dentro
Y ahora qué pena me da [x3]
Resulta y pasa que ya no eres mi tormento
Se te hizo, se te hizo tarde... Ya yo no te quiero

A veces suele no tenerte
Pero no puedo ser el mismo
Que se moría por tus besos
Que te entregaba el corazón
Ya no pude seguir
Como un tonto esperando
A que me quisieras, o me dejaras
Con el alma llena de dolor
Me canse de amarte tanto y que no hicieras lo mismo,
Me canse de ser aquel que se creía algo tuyo
Me canse de no creer que mendigaba un cariño
Me aburrí de ver que no era
Casi nada en tu mundo
Y ahora que vienes a mi
Con tu arrepentimiento
Quiero que tu sepas que esta ves mi amor,
Esta vez te toca sufrir

Se te hizo, se te hizo tarde
Pa valorar mis sentimientos
Se te hizo, se te hizo tarde
Para llevarte aquí dentro
Y ahora qué pena me da [x3]
Resulta y pasa que ya no eres mi tormento

Se te hizo, se te hizo tarde
Pa valorar mis sentimientos
Se te hizo, se te hizo tarde...
Ya yo no te quiero [bis]

I Never Knew,Leo Sayer,2005,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leosayer/ineverknew.html,"I never knew nobody
Who loved me better than the way you do
I never knew no-one like you

I never knew this feeling
I never trusted no-one in my life
But I know with you it's right

'Cos baby you're there
When I need you
Baby you're there
If I'm blue
And I know that I'm blessed
I can only confess
That there's so much that I never knew

I never knew how happy
I could be with you here by my side
As I look at you tonight

All day I'm just dreaming
That's all that I do
Can't wait for the hours
That I spend with you

I never knew nobody
Who loved me better than the way you do
But there's so much I never knew
No there's so much I never knew
There's so much I never – knew…

Paper Rain,Amanda Stott,2005,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/amandastott/paperrain.html,"Wide-eyed, maybe that's true
But most of the time I can see through you
You say I'm too sweet for my own good
But when your anger lets you down, understood

You're burnin' up from inside out
While you're riding you're knocked down
There are things that you can't see
And one of them is me

You've been walking in a paper rain
There is a storm inside your head
On this perfect day
Come down from your cloud and walk my way
And let the paper rain
Just blow away

Tell me what I should do 
When you want to paint a day every shade of blue
Is it too late for us to shine
Can you crawl into the light and just be mine

Your world of words is so unreal
Sometimes I wonder if you feel
The same emotions that I do
When I'm close to you

You've been walking in a paper rain
There is a storm inside your head
On this perfect day
Come down from your cloud and walk my way
And let the paper rain
Just blow away

Do you wonder what would happen if you let me in?
Are you afraid to give yourself away?
Will the fervor disappear and then I come crashing in 
Crashing in to the light of day

You've been walking in a paper rain
There is a storm inside your head
On this perfect day
Come down from your cloud and walk my way
And let the paper rain

You've been walking in a paper rain
There is a storm inside your head
On this perfect day
Come down from your cloud and walk my way
And let the paper rain, hey

Prayer,"Westenra, Hayley",2005,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/hayleywestenra/prayer.html,"Let your arms enfold us
Through the dark of night
Will your angels hold us
Till we see the light

Hush, lay down your troubled mind
The day has vanished and left us behind
And the wind - whispering soft lullabies
Will soothe - so close your weary eyes

Let your arms enfold us
Through the dark of night
Will your angels hold us
Till we see the light

Sleep, angels will watch over you
And soon beautiful dreams will come true
Can you feel spirits embracing your soul
So dream while secrets of darkness unfold

Let your arms enfold us
Through the dark of night
Will your angels hold us
Till we see the light

Let your arms enfold us
Through the dark of night
Will your angels hold us
Till we see the light

Rural Route,"Knight, Chris",2006,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/chrisknight/ruralroute.html,"I built a fire up on the hill; I sat in the woods and drank my fill
Talked to God all night, took another shot at setting me right
Then I walked down to the road, filled a beer can full of 22 holes
Then I said goodbye, yeah I said goodbye

I'd go back but I can't go home, cause river is up and the road is closed
And there ain't no telephone at my mother's house
And all the lights are out, down on the rural route

There ain't much of nothin' left, this place where I became myself
Ghosts and memories, I'd walk on by but they'd follow me
I'd seen plenty on down the road. Asked him if he'd seen my brother
He just said no, well I guess I'd better go

I'd go back but I can't go home, cause river is up and the road is closed
And there ain't no telephone at my mother's house
And all the lights are out, down on the rural route

I built a fire up on the hill; I sat in the woods and drank my fill
Talked to God all night, took another shot at setting me right
Then I'd just walk away, ain't nothin' here I want to remember anyway
Least not today

I'd go back but I can't go home, cause river is up and the road is closed
And there ain't no telephone at my mother's house

The Watchmaker's Dial,Greg Graffin,2006,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/greggraffin/thewatchmakersdial.html,"Oh, yonder stands the prophet, words are music to our ears,
But down among the sinners, only pain and sweat and tears

The sermon soothes the simple but the rest are rapt with fear,
Oh no, too late to hold a trial, time doesn't wait for the watchmaker's dial

In the best laid plans of history lie the ruins of the past
And a chronicle of suffering shows the mythic pall they cast

To believe is true religion but to see is truth at last
Oh no, too late to hold a trial, time doesn't wait for the watchmaker's dial

(Hey!)

Chip off the block
Seems that I'm not
As good as I thought
Or as bad as you want
The line has been drawn
What side are you on?
Try to do it right
But everything is wrong

And so I stare at
The dregs of the earth
Clear blue skies
To the deepest of dirt
With hands stretched out
Looking pious and pure
To the ten padlocks
Strapped on your front door

There ain't nuthin'
But heroes and villains
More villains than heroes
But can you tell
One from the next?
Can you go down from zero?

There ain't nuthin'
But heroes and villains
More villains than heroes
All lined up
From the east to the west
Black hat born or an 'S' on your chest

Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now

(Go! Yeah! Come on!)

Who got in your head?
Who told you those things?
You better put 'em up
When you hear the bell ring
Seeing things clear
In the blackest of night
And sometimes the good guys
They dont wear white

There ain't nuthin'
But heroes and villains
More villains than heroes
But can you tell
One from the next?
Can you go down from zero?

There ain't nuthin'
But heroes and villains
More villains than heroes
All lined up
From the east to the west
Black hat born or an 'S' on your chest

(That's right, that's right
Now check this out)

Gangsters and mobs
With itchy trigger fingers
Do-gooder knights
Or some love song singers
They all got their rules, man,
Are trades of the trick
But give 'em one chance and
I swear they'll all switch

(Put your hands up in the air, let me see you tonight))

Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now

There ain't nuthin'

More villains than heroes
But can you tell
One from the next?
Can you go down from zero?

There ain't nuthin'
But heroes and villains
More villains than heroes

A Far Cry,BoySetsFire,2006,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/boysetsfire/afarcry.html,"Find myself through the sight of a gun
And selling war never looked so fun
Stand in line for the latest attraction
Dressed in murder like it's hip and in fashion

Walked in like we own the place
(Bright light corpse)
Trigger pressed down, sweat is cold
(Rain down fire)
Bodies burn with babies in their arms
(Love as trash)
Hope is where the heart can die
(What we bring)

Son into heir
They made me my bed to lie

Find myself through the sight of a gun
And selling war never looked so fun
Stand in line for the latest attraction
Dressed in murder like it's hip and in fashion

Finding ways to be a god
(Where's my gun)
Where the blood can drown my soul
(Rain down fire)
All I wanted was destination
(All I got)
All I got was all I gave
(Hope as shit)

Son into heirs
They made me my bed to lie

Find myself through the sight of a gun
And selling war never looked so fun
Stand in line for the latest attraction
Dressed in murder like it's hip and in fashion

Give up because you'll never justify the blood on your fingers
The bullshit look of concern
The cover ups lie and the bloated corpse
Of a system that is begging to burn

Surrender
Surrender...

Oh Lord, our father
My young patriots
Idols of our hearts
Go forth to battle
Be though near them
With them
In spirit
We also go forth from a sweet peace of our beloved fireside
To smite them both
Oh Lord, our god
Help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreds
With our shells
Help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale warmth
Of their patriot death
Help us to drown out the thunder of their guns with shrieks of their wounded
Writhing in pain
Help us to lay waste their humble homes
With hurricanes of fire
Help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows
With unavailing grief
Help us to tear them out roofless
With their little children
To wander unafriended
In the waste of their desolated land and rags
And hunger and thirst
Sports [?] of the sun, flames of summer
And icy winds of winter
Broken in spirit
Worn with prevail and pouring
Need for the refuge of the grave and denied it
For our sake, who adore thee
Lord, bless their hopes
Blight their lives
Protract their bitter pilgrimage
Make heavy their steps
Water their way with tears
Stain the white snow with the blood of their wounded feet
We ask it
In the spirit of love
Of Him, who is the source of love
And who is the ever faithful refuge
And friend of all that are sore, beset and seek his aid
With humble and contrite hearts
Amen

I want to find the water
That will wash this whole damn slate clean

Break down
Break up
We sleep in what we create

Right now, I'm living so much hate
Right here, my sins have all been paid

To you
Your friends
And for your sake
Dirty and so depraved

My knees have bled to hold you here
But now I've lost the taste
For lies force fed as time well spent

Right now, I'm living so much hate
Right here, my sins have all been paid

To you
Your friends
And for your sake
Dirty and so depraved

And if another angel says 'Just grin and bear it'
I might be forced to smash his head
Against the wall
And never sin again

And if another angel says 'Just grin and bear it'
I might be forced to smash his fucking head
Against the wall
And never sin again

Against myself
Or trust in anyone

Write me off
For suffering
It's a joke
I give up

And you could live your life without me if you had to
And you believe that in the end it all works out right
And I might if not for you
And if you ask one which one lives just alone for love
I do
There was a time when all signs pointed to the warm south
The planets all lined up and built a new house
And everything we talked about felt like a prophecy
And when you looked at me they all came true
And if you asked which one wants to go the distance
I do
I'm gonna rack my mind one last time until I cannot think
I'm gonna dip into your memory and take a good stiff drink
And when I'm drunk on the last drop of sadness about how we went wrong
I'm gonna play this song
Make some coffee black and strong
Give thanks for healing time
And finally make up my mind

'Cause you'll never be alone

Fight the darkness
We gotta fight the darkness

You present desire
Silver strings on gold lyre
Tear off our clothes
And throw them on the floor
Now we don't need them anymore
And we'll never feel the cold
'Cause we'll never be alone

Fight the darkness
We gotta fight the darkness

If I Could Build My Whole World Around You,Marc Broussard,2007,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/marcbroussard/ificouldbuildmywholeworldaroundyou.html,"Oh, if I could build my whole world around you, darlin'
First, I'd put Heaven by your side
Pretty flowers would grow wherever you walked, honey
And over your head would be the bluest sky

Then I'd take every drop of rain
And wash all your troubles away
I'd have my whole world wrapped up in you, darlin'
And that would be alright, oh yes, it will

If I could build my whole world around you
I'd make your eyes the morning sun
Oh I'd put so much love where there is sorrow
And I'd put joy where there's never been none

And I'd give my love to you
For you to keep for the rest of your life
Oh, and happiness would surely be ours
And that would be alright, oh, yes, it would

Oh, if I could build my whole world around you
I'd give you the greatest gift that any woman could possess
And I'd step into this world you created
And give you true love and tenderness

And there'd be something new with every tomorrow
To make this world better as days go by
That is if I could just build my world around you
If I could build my whole world around you
And that would be alright, oh, yeah

If I could build my whole world around you
If I could build it, build it all around you
And that would be alright, oh, yeah
If I could just build my world around you
If I could build it build it my whole world around you
And that would be alright

What I See,Dirty Projectors,2007,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dirtyprojectors/whatisee.html,"I want to live
I wish I was dead
I've got to close my eyes

I wish I was dead

This feeling
Haunts me
Behind these eyes the shell seems so empty
Does anything live inside?

I want to live
I wish I was dead
I've got to close my eyes
I want to live
I wish I was dead

Life's cold
And it reaches inside
I reach to feel and to live
A desperate wish begins
And from the start
I can see the end

I want to live
I wish I was dead
I've got to close my eyes
I want to live
I wish I was dead

Vengeance Calls On You,Terror,2007,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/terror/vengeancecallsonyou.html,"Never - will you see the things I see
Nothing - you can steal my words but from you they're empty

A fake, a fraud, a leech disgraced
You have no heart so hang yourself in shame

And you're so hollow you have no clue
Down, sink down
Don't look my way
When vengeance calls on you

Never - cut down to size by the hands of truth
Nothing - can't stand on your own because there's nothing inside of you

You can steal my words, say what I say
But from you they're empty

If The Roof Is Leaking,Bronze Radio Return,2008,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bronzeradioreturn/iftheroofisleaking.html,"Now we can dance, all alone
Or we can even take a chance and never go home
It's the thought of running out with a dash of doubt
Makes me never want to loose my song
And if we stop time we still grow older
Cause the days still pass in our minds
And if we get out where we living now
We best be living with some brand new eyes

So saddle up and put the car in drive
Put the radio on to find a song to tell your momma good bye
And if the roof is leaking slowly
Then why don't we just stand outside?

We may find a new place to lay down
Along the long horizon line
Until the sun don't shine
Don't hold back, don't be bored, oh no...
Because I've heard this track all before
And it's time to move on
And it's time to move on
Now let's romance, let's forget
And let's take a chance with no regrets
Cause if we don't stop moving we won't stop loosing it yet
And it all starts in the studio
And when we get done, we want the radio
And when the curtain pulls we want the people to know
That the groove keeps moving and so should you

Pack your bags and put the car in drive
Put the radio on to find a song to tell your momma good bye
And if the roof is leaking slowly
Then why don't we just stand outside?

So let's find another place to call home
So let's find another place to call home
Cause it's the east coast villain on the west side killing
With the south beach prize on the north shore chillin
The water keeps spilling and the fire keeps burning
And there's smoke in this town so let's get out of this place

Alicia Ross,"Edwards, Kathleen",2008,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kathleenedwards/aliciaross.html,"I am a girl with a forgettable face
No matter my colour, no matter my name
At work there is a boy and he treats me well
My old friends from high school,
I see them around
August is here I can't believe how fast
Soon there will be winter and snow on the ground
Maybe by then I could get my own place
Closer to the city if that's ok

But Mamma, can you hear me?
As I dragged on my day's last cigarette
He pulled me so hard off my
Very own back door steps
And he laid me in his garden
All the years i've watched him tend
And then he took me, Mamma
So I could never tell you about it

Inside of this moment there are
Things I wish I could know
Like my ring size, your ring size,
And the hour I was born
My dad's middle name, your favourite song
Was your darkest day as dark as this one?

Mamma, can you hear me?
As I dragged on my day's last cigarette
He pulled me so hard off my
Very own back door steps
And he laid me in his garden
All the years i've watched him tend
He took me, Mamma
So I could never tell you about it
Now I'm a girl who's face they'll never forget

Come back here the same.
I thought that I past them,

So I woke up today,
And I'm still sitting here.
It's just like the last one,
Then the others before them.
Yeah I promised I'd change about this time last year,
We both know how that went.
I guess you're not so important.

I'm ready for change,
I'm ready for change,
I'm ready for change,
I'm ready for...
I'm ready for change,
I'm ready for change.

And so what does it take to start over again?
Step out of comfort, my friends?
Yes, and change for the better.
And so why do I wait and sit here 'til the end,
Wait 'til it's over and then,
Wish that I had done better?

I'm ready for change,

Ich Kann Wenn Ich Will,Peter Maffay,2008,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/petermaffay/ichkannwennichwill.html,"Wenn ich nicht will das es so weiter geht
Dann muss ich was dagegen tun

Wenn ich meine ganze Kraft zusammen nehm
Bestehe ich den Sturm und die Flut

Wenn die mir im Fernsehn die Welt erklären
Mir erzählen wollen, wie es geh

Dann wird es Zeit ihn den Saft abzudrehen
Und was tun, das der Wind sich dreht
Das geht

Ich kann wenn ich will, und ich weiß, wenn ich will, dann kann ich
Ich kann wenn ich will
Ich kann wenn ich will, und ich weiß, wenn ich will, dann kann ich
Ich kann wenn ich will

Keiner sagt, was für mich richtig ist
Denn das weiß ich am besten allein

Keiner sagt mir, was für mich wichtig ist
Darauf fall ich nicht mehr rein

Ich sag immer nur das was ich denk
Und ich denk nur das was ich will

Willst du meine Seele, die verkauf ich nicht
Denn ich glaube an mich und das, was ich Fühl! Das geht

Ich kann wenn ich will, und ich weiß, wenn ich will, dann kann ich
Ich kann wenn ich will (und ich will und ich will)
Ich kann wenn ich will, und ich weiß, wenn ich will, dann kann ich
Ich kann wenn ich will

Ich jag die Zweifel jetzt zum Teufel
Da wo ich bin, ist immer vorn - immer vorn

Ich kann wenn ich will, und ich weiß, wenn ich will, dann kann ich
Ich kann wenn ich will (und ich will und ich will)
Ich kann wenn ich will, und ich weiß, wenn ich will, dann kann ich

I Can't Help It,"Roots, The",2008,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/roots/icanthelpit.html,"[Hook - Mercedes Martinez]
I, I, I Can't Help It, I, I, I Can't Help It
I Can't Help It, I Can't Help It
I Can't Help It, I Can't Help It
I, I, I Can't Help It, I, I, I Can't Help It
I Can't Help It, I Can't Help It
I Can't Help It, I Can't Help It

[Verse 1 - Malik B]
Live with it, that's how I survive with it
Talk jive with it, you take a dive with it
Connive with it, depart and arrive with it
Harsh thrive, that's why it's part I with it
I did it, make rhymes in five minutes
Mind of a dentist, crimes of a menace
Press rewind, see what you find in my image
Take you niggas back to the line of the scrimmage
'Riq, you know we pull a freak with the flow
Talk's cheap, that's why we speak with the dough
Ill technique show I'm sleek with the flow
It's cold outside, nigga, sleep with the snow
I tweek in the low tone, freak with the ozone
I can't help hiding my secrets that's so known
I only do what I got to 'cause it's possible
And climbin' over whatever's known as an obstacle

[Verse 2 - Black Thought]
Ugh, I Can't Help It, maybe I'm selfish
Maybe the way I'm runnin' is becomin' a health risk
All I can see is smoke through tortoise shell
Gazelle 650's, I'm feelin' like I'm makin' a sales pitch
My head already so heavy, it's makin' the scales tip
I got my own pressure and got everyone else's
I'm rehabilitated, still feelin' rebellious
Candidate of heart failure, more pills then Elvis
In a layer cake, half-chocolate, half-velvet
I'm listenin' to some Howe Melvin
I got too many options, there's so many toxins
Yo, ain't no really tellin' what we killin' ourselves with
I lit a cigarette and inhaled it
I'm thinkin' of some rhymes more iller then a threatening ailment
I'm on some bomb threat in the mail shit
Because of all the things I dealt with, nigga, I Can't Help It

[Hook - Mercedes Martinez]
I, I, I Can't Help It, I, I, I Can't Help It
I Can't Help It, I Can't Help It
I Can't Help It, I Can't Help It
I, I, I Can't Help It, I, I, I Can't Help It
I Can't Help It, I Can't Help It
I Can't Help It, I Can't Help It

[Verse 3 - Porn]
I never said I'm ready to die, but I accept it
Never said I'm ready for war, but I'm protected
I don't even know when it's comin', but I expect it
Lost all semblance of hope, so now I'm left with
Nervous conditions, addictions, in addition
to vixens that mixed in with the wrong crowd
My life is on a flight that's goin' down
My mother had an abortion for the wrong child
With the time I felt love, that's gone now
Been replaced by purple rains and some storm clouds
Misery love misery
So why make friends? Let's make some enemies
And now I got a habit that wasn't meant for me
Now I'm in a marriage that wasn't meant to be
One more reason to change identity
The cars, the crime, K's, penalties

[Hook - Mercedes Martinez]
I, I, I Can't Help It, I, I, I Can't Help It
I Can't Help It, I Can't Help It
I Can't Help It, I Can't Help It

That's The Way It Goes,Maino,2008,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/maino/thatsthewayitgoes.html,"When I got money, everybody loves me
Ain't got no money, some niggas acting funny
And when I'm hungry, they can't do nothing for me
That's the way, the way it goes
Cos when I'm home they say that they my homies
And when I'm gone then they don't even know me
Now I'm hot and niggas wanna show me, show me love
And that's the way it goes

I remember waking up to the sight of steel bars, it was dark
I couldn't see the sun through the bars
freezin in the cell, I was trapped in these walls
no letter, no girl, just the comfort of the walls
But the world don't change, since the flow don't change and
Everybody here now, that ain't no name
Lord protect me from my friends, I can deal with my enemies
But I ain't sure who's a friend or an enemy
Since the Smack DVD's, everybody lovin' me
But when I was thirsty, they wouldn't hawk-spit on me
Bitches poppin up, wow, now they wanna get with me
Fifteen years, same bitches wasn't missin me
Man it's funny how, people act funny style
Niggas switch, when they think you getting money now
When the sun shines, niggas wanna come around
But they disappear, when that rain starts coming down

When I got money, everybody loves me
Ain't got no money, some niggas acting funny
And when I'm hungry, they can't do nothing for me
That's the way, the way it goes
Cos when I'm home they say that they my homies
And when I'm gone then they don't even know me
Now I'm hot and niggas wanna show me, show me love
And that's the way it goes

What's good, different day, same shit
It's amazing, how success change shit
Now niggas trying to count what's in my pocket
They be like ""Can I hold"", ""Nah homie, I ain't got it"" (Damn)
You trying to cling to me, you ain't deceiving me
And when I started, you niggas, you ain't believe in me
Instead of support, y'all just hated
Said I'm too wild to rap, I ain't supposed to make it
That's fucked up yo', but I'm supposed to take it
No you got the nerve to act like, we related
Just yesterday I couldn't get a dime from nobody
Couldn't get studio, time from nobody
Tyco believed in me, told me I'm wholebody
Did it by ourselves dawg, we didn't have nobody
Hustle hard, we 'bout to E-Ride
These leeched niggas hands out, looking for free rides

When I got money, everybody loves me
Ain't got no money, some niggas acting funny
And when I'm hungry, they can't do nothing for me
That's the way, the way it goes
Cos when I'm home they say that they my homies
And when I'm gone then they don't even know me
Now I'm hot and niggas wanna show me, show me love
And that's the way it goes

Yeah listen
I got family popping up, out of nowhere (oh yeah?)
Got a bunch of new cousins, coming out, all year
If I knew I had this much love
Might have never hit the street, might have never sold drugs
Might have stayed up in school and never popped guns
And been a better role model for my own son
Where was you when my life was needy
And my pops was high, my momma could not feed me
And the lights was off, and the block would tease me
You wasn't there, when shit wasn't easy
Before rap, niggas they didn't hold it down
Since I'm hot, of course, everybody love me now

When I got money, everybody loves me
Ain't got no money, some niggas acting funny
And when I'm hungry, they can't do nothing for me
That's the way, the way it goes
Cos when I'm home they say that they my homies
And when I'm gone then they don't even know me
Now I'm hot and niggas wanna show me, show me love
And that's the way it goes

I'm The Man Who Rode The Mule Around The World,"Wainwright III, Loudon",2009,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/loudonwainwrightiii/imthemanwhorodethemulearoundtheworld.html,"I promised to meet her when the clock struck twenty-three
Down in the village, just four miles out of town
She runs the local tavern and the liquor's always free
But the pickles sell for nineteen cents a pound

Oh, she's my Daisy, she's black eyed and she's crazy
The prettiest girl I thought I ever saw
Now her breath smells sweet but I'd rather smell her feet
For she's my freckle faced consumptive Sara Jane

He's the man who rode the mule around the world
He's the man who rode the mule around the world
I rode in Noah's Ark and I'm as happy as a lark
I'm the man who rode the mule around the world

I was born about ten thousand years ago
And there's nothing on this earth that I don't know
I saw Peter, Paul and Moses playing ring around the roses
And I can whup the man that says it isn't so

He's the man who rode the mule around the world
He's the man who rode the mule around the world
And for Pharaoh's little kiddies I built all the pyramiddies
I'm the man who rode the mule around the world

Queen Elizabeth, she fell in love with me
We were married in Milwaukee secretly
But I rose up and I shook her and went off with General Hooker
To shoot mosquitoes down in Memphis, Tennessee

He's the man who rode the mule around the world
He's the man who rode the mule around the world
I set the flags a-flying when George Washington quit lying
I'm the man who rode the mule around the world

I'm a very highly educated man
There's not a thing that I don't understand
I've been around so long that I used to sing this song
When Abraham and Isaac rushed the can

He's the man who rode the mule around the world
He's the man who rode the mule around the world
Oh, I rode in Noah's Ark, I'm as happy as a lark
I'm the man who rode the mule around the world

Yo no te suelto mas
Es un rapto de inconsciencia nena
Yo no te suelto mas

Somos hijos del rigor
Mas la cuerda aprieta el cuello
Mas perverso es el consuelo
Un morbo que crece
Crece, crece hasta el cielo
Quédate

No te suelto mas
Yo no te suelto mas
Tu defensa es formidable nena
Yo no te suelto mas

Vamos a tenernos aquí mi amor
Alimentando la utopía
Duermo en tus labios
De un siglo largo como un día
Duermo en tus labios
Pero por favor no sonrías
O caeré

No te suelto mas
No lo pienses más
Ni en un rapto de inconsciencia nena
No te suelto más

Long Gone Lonesome Blues,Hank Williams Jr.,2009,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/hankwilliamsjr/longgonelonesomeblues.html,"I went down to the river to watch the fish swim by
But I got to the river so lonesome I wanted to die, oh Lord
And then I jumped in the river, but the doggone river was dry
She's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue

I had me a woman who couldn't be true
She made me for my money and she made me blue
A man needs a woman that he can lean on
But my leanin' post is done left and gone
She's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue

I'm gonna find me a river, one that's cold as ice
And when I find me that river, Lord I'm gonna pay the price, oh Lord
I'm goin' down in it three times, but Lord I'm only comin' up twice
She's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue

She told me on Sunday she was checkin' me out
Long about Monday she was nowhere about
And here it is Tuesday, ain't had no news
I got them gone but not forgotten blues
She's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue

Losing Sleep(Bonus Track),Parachute,2009,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/parachute/losingsleep.html,"Stop these lies and start again,
Break through bone and cut through skin,
See just where your heart has been,
By the trail left behind you.
Oh it takes no time to make things clear,
I might be blind but i can hear,
By the sound of things I'm losing sleep,
For all the right reasons.

And it goes down hard for me,
That you just don't, don't seem to see,
At the top you'll, you'll always be,
Looking down
To find yourself.
So call me when you get here,
And tell me when you hit that ground
Tell me when you get here,
Tell me when your plan breaks down.

When you stop your heart to make some space,
For shallow drinks and social games,
I kept it for reminders sake
Of before the bottle found you.

And it goes down hard for me,
That you just don't, don't seem to see,
At the top you'll, you'll always be,
Looking down
To find yourself.

And
Ohhh, whoa whoa ohhh
Ohhh, whoa whoa ohhh
Ohhh, whoa whoa ohhh
Whoa ohhh 

And it goes down hard for me,
That you just don't seem to see,
At the top you'll, you'll always be,
Looking down
To find yourself.

So tell me when you get here,
Tell me when you hit that ground,
Tell me when you get here,
Tell me when your plan breaks down.

Your party on E, if Snoopy don't come
You smoke about a zone, I smoke about a drum
Burnt in the club, my hands on her thigh
A Eastside nigga put his hood in the sky

Turn that ass around and drop it like a fool

Put it in the air, listen to the drum
Snoop Dogg said it, we gettin turnt up
Swishers all around, gettin burnt up

Whisper in her ear, then I touch her on the face

Wonder if the kids you bought bikes foe you have they wrote you a letter
Wonder if the niggahs that did a song witchu have you heard from them niggahs
I wonder how many of your dogs done came by and visit ya
Wonder if the crackas you made millions done chopped it up witcha,
Wonder if the hoes you used to fuck, if they even sent ya some pictas
Wonder if the niggas you called yo dawgs if they eitha foe ya or against ya?
Yo whole situation done taught me alot my niggah
When you winnin niggahs hate ya & when ya down they against ya

It ain't a judge or prosacuter that got more power than god whatever you do my niggah don't let em take what's in yo heart doin day for day indapendent on niggahs can be hard believe in you and keep yo faith cause that's what's smart yo mamma and yo kids are the ones that love you from the start they seen the system break clicks and tear em apart stayin prayed up my niggah is more important than a charge that's what real niggahs do they pass it to god the streets a muthafucka my niggah cause they switch and they change it's hard foe niggahs to stay out chere cause they pussys in the game a niggah runnin with cha done flipped now he sprayin yo name the crackas neva do shit niggahs put em in ya game

Burn It Down,"Goudie, Rex",2010,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rexgoudie/burnitdown.html,"She lit a cigarette and told me were through*
A steady hand tapped dashes to the floor
She held herself together just to watch me come unglued
Set fire to everything I've ever felt before

The bitter taste of heartache still makes me wanna choke
Cause' I remember watching all those years go up in smoke

So burn it down, burn it down now
Cause' I can't walk away
I need to see what's left go up in flames
So burn it down, burn it down now
Until there's nothing left to say
Cause' I don't have the nerve to let it die out
So I'll burn it all down

Waking up alone will come easier in time
But this empty bed won't ever feel the same
I try to hold myself to keep you off my mind
I'd try anything, everything, to keep my head from playing games

Cause' I remember watching all those years go up in smoke

So burn it down, burn it down now
Cause' I can't walk away
I need to see what's left go up in flames
So burn it down, burn it down now
Until there's nothing left to say
Cause' I don't have the nerve to let it die out

Maybe she'd turn around

And the world feels out of place, all around me
So I wait, and I pray, I'll run into her someday

If she could see me now
If she could see me breaking down
Maybe she'd turn around

So many things I wish I could tell her, show her
Just how bad I really need her, miss her, love her

Out the waist of her cutoff jeans
Her damp hair blowing out the window
In the summer breeze
Got the sunshine
Shining through the windshield
Got a hand on her leg
The other on the wheel

Every time we touch

Come peasant king to own him

Let loving hearts enthrone him

Don't Let Me Go,Nyck Caution,2011,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nyckcaution/dontletmego.html,"Watch my back so I make sure
You're right behind me as before
Yesterday the night before tomorrow
Dry my eyes so you won't know
Dry my eyes so I won't show
I know you're right behind me

And don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight

I thought I made it obvious
But you be chilling like a snobby bitch
I'm in the lobby of your building
Ringing on the door, you're behind it
I could hear you breathing and crying a little [?]
What I hear, man this bitch caught a big top
Gave you my living and this how you're going to live?
Without the man who support you
Get someone to escort you before
I do myself, and I suffer with a lawsuit
I ain't trying to assault you
But talking is never solving shit
Because what's little turns into a fucking argument
You always starting shit so I'm never calm
We can't catchup so we relish, like a mother fucking condiment
Was this condom in?
Or did I hit it raw?
I was faded from the bar
And when we got back to the crib
I didn't mean to get involved
But one thing lead to another
And her panties hit the floor
So here you standing by the door
Cops on the way, you can't stand this anymore
Maybe I'm the same
We could work it out
Baby I'm just hopeful for a change
But all you do is resist, and speaking of all this pain
I know that this shit hurt
Trust me I feel this burden too
And that person that you love is not loving you
I know that shit hurt, I feel the burden too
Baby, I'm always going to be in love with you

And don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight
Don't you let me go, let me go tonight

Breaking promises
And you be sleeping on the kid like pajamas did
Yeah, you said that you would never change
But a fucking taste of an adult
Turned you into an asshole
Do you remember what it's Christmas?
You happy with your fam, and got granted all of your wishes
Now you older and you standing with some bitches
And your parents making efforts
But you mind your fucking business
Listen, look
Before you know it you'll be older as fuck
I see my mom looking at me like I told her I
Must move on
Fucking timings a bitch
Remember lunch?
When I was just rhyming and shit
And trying to find me a chick
But they be lying and shit
But I supply them with dick
That they be dying to lick
But I be crying and shit
With no eyes on nyck
The fucking pressure to stick
And snort lines of this shit
Got me feeling like a bitch
Because I say no
I only do lines when I spit
Rather than selling all this crack and coke
I just rap and hope
That my shit is half as dope
So if you following what I'm preaching
Maybe you can make it through the evening
I gave you every reason to doubt
Still I'm keeping a mouth
And imma keep talking until they figure me out

Halo,Cimorelli,2011,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cimorelli/halo.html,"Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make up a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can see your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest nights
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again

Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
The risk that I'm taking
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can see your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can see your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
Halo, halo
Oh

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can see your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo

(Halo)
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can see your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I Wanna Put My Willy In GTA V,"Bull, Dan",2012,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/danbull/iwannaputmywillyingtav.html,"I hopped onto the net today
Saw a link to the trailer for GTA
So straight away I pressed play
In wait to be blown away
I saw a couple walk
Through the mist on the beach
The pink light blissfully sweet
You could instantly see
The emission of heat
The sand on your feet
And wind from the sea
Joggers run past on the promenade
Then the camera pans up long and hard
There's no mistakin' it
From the palms in the valley
We're in L.A.

GTA: San Andreas
A familiar name to the badass players
But as beautiful as it is
It could use a couple of clips
Of gore galore
A smorgasbord of footage
Of Bloods and Crips
Popping some clips
That was one of the best things
Hey, is that Carlton
From The Fresh Prince?
Loads of peeps on the hard streets
But no sign of a car thief
My God, I hope I get to actually
Drive a wind turbine
Sweet!

I couldn't give a fuck for a crop duster
I want to hit a cop
With a knuckle duster
Don't psychoanalyze me
In real life, I'm quite nice, see?
I see Tai Chi and exterminators
Have replaced Hot Coffee like a percolator
Not rock climbing and a driving range
Let's see more signs of guys in pain
I want an overload of action shots
Those moments happen lots
And are why we play GTA
Everyday and simply cannot stop

Hahaha!
Grand Theft Auto V
Grand Theft Auto V
Oh, isn't it exciting?

Southern Heart,"Walkmen, The",2012,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/walkmen/southernheart.html,"Family comes from Kentucky
And there's bourbon in the blood
They left the country for the city in 1951
Me I'm in between two worlds
Saw you on TV last night

Life looks easy on the TV
We ride into some blue evening
I fill my evenings with images of hazy here after
I don't even know your name
It's your southern heart I'm after
It's your southern heart I'm after

Tell me again how you love all the men you were after
Tell me again how you love all the men you were after
Tell me again how you love all the men you were after

Appalachia,"Wolfe, Chelsea",2012,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/chelseawolfe/appalachia.html,"It was the way we always knew that we never had the clue
that we never had the chance like the others in the dance
like black diamonds, ash and light
like the mines and anthracite
split-tongued fellows, venom-survived
violence only against the vile
e'er we bleed into the wild
then laid to rest there, man or child
this shining gutter in the sun
is it worth it in the run

O God Our Help In Ages Past,Don Moen,2012,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/donmoen/ogodourhelpinagespast.html,"Oh God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal home.

Under the shadow of Thy throne
Thy saints have dwelt secure;
Sufficient is Thine arm alone,
And our defense is sure.

Before the hills in order stood,
Or earth received her frame,
From everlasting Thou art God,
To endless years the same.

Our God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal home.

Reach Out,Nas,2012,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nas/reachout.html,"DJ Hot Day

This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you, aw baby
I see you standing there
So lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that you're home
I look into your eyes
I said I know you very well
I see a mirror of my life
A reflection of myself

3:45 AM can't sleep, can't dream
I'm stuck, money problems pop up
How will I survive?
Guess it's best to decide not to decide
So that's my decision
Whatever happens happens
I keep making my millions
Can see myself in Presidential campaign dinners
But I'm passing blunts around a bunch of gang members
When you're too hood to be in them Hollywood circles
And you're too rich to be in that hood that birthed you
And you become better than legends you thought were the greatest
And outgrow women you loved and thought you could stay with
Life become clearer when you wipe down your mirror
And leave notes around for yourself to remember
I like to teach and build
With brothers about how easy it is to reach a mil
All you need is some skill, then it's grind time
Imagination better than knowledge, says Einstein
It's all in the mind
Nasty the nicest, I'm somewhat of a psychic
Just one minute after it's heard
You all'll recite it, you all'll repeat it
You'll call me a genius, if you didn't
Now that I said it I forced you to think it
Write in my little vignettes, sipping Moët
Bitch when you vision me, you vision the best
When I was young they called me Olu's son
Now he's Nas' father, I was the good seed
He was the wise gardener

This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you, aw baby
I see you standing there
So lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that you're home
I look into your eyes
I said I know you very well
I see a mirror of my life
A reflection of myself

Yeah, what y'all know about this
Yo, beautiful life, often I dream that I can bring my niggas
Conservatives don't understand slang linguistics
The burbs talking like the hood will change with quickness
Love the skinny model chicks but I prefer the thickness
So what I rap about my riches and I'm ostentatious
Get out a gangsta's business, seems to me your thoughts are basic
Try to compare what you live to the life I master
See the fly shit I wear, you try to rock it after
Big bracelets, golden Egyptian faces
White wine spritzers and Switzerland on vacation
The strip club scene favors Josephine Baker
Dope fiend neighbors, growing up I seen paper
I describe it, hope you can visualize it
This is reminiscent to all the parks in the project
When my British Knights can rival your Foamposites
Don't make me pull my Lottos out the closet
Ha ha ha

This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you, aw baby
I see you standing there
So lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that you're home
I look into your eyes
I said I know you very well
I see a mirror of my life
A reflection of myself

You remind me, oh
Yes it's true baby, ah yeah

Or sappy poetry
Love at first sight's for suckers
At least it used to be
Look, girls are nice, once or twice
Till I find someone new

Turns out that love ain't blind, its dumb

Worked a day in your life
In fact, you're so revoltin'

Look Out,Modern Baseball,2012,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/modernbaseball/lookout.html,"Look out I’m on a search for self destruction
Crawling over the great plains of my cell phone contacts
Just to, find a pretty girl to take home late at night
To hold my sweaty palms and stuff

Heads up because I’m always moving forward
And if sometimes I get scared I know that I can look towards you
Back of the pack but not back of my mind
And that’s the worst part knowing I gotta’ find someone new

Yeah, I said that I’m always moving forward
But my head’s really on a swivel
Searching for the tracks I made when I left you
And though it sounds like I lost what I got
What I’m really trying to say is I’m gonna’ get back what I lost
So you better tell your fucking heart to look out

Ballad Of Trayvon Martin,"Hoge, Will",2012,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/willhoge/balladoftrayvonmartin.html,"Trayvon Martin was a young black kid
Doin' the same things that we all did
Outside walkin' down the streets alone
Just talkin' to a girl on the telephone

Mindin' his business, not doin' nothin' wrong
But then George Zimmerman had to come along
Self-appointed wanna-be police man
With 9-1-1 call and a pistol in his hand

Oh, chariot swing low
Come to take another young angel home
Underneath that February moon
Another young brother gone way to soon

George told the cops ""The kid's on drugs""
But what he really wants to say is ""Black kids are thugs""
The dispatcher says not to make no stand
But he's gonna take matters into his own hands

Trayvon tells the girl that there's some guy
That's followin' him 'round and he don't know why
She says to hang up the phone and run
But the next thing you hear is the ringin' of a gun

Neighbors call the cops 'cause they hear screams
Another black child that never gets out of his teens
Zimmerman claims that is was self-defense
So Police Chief Lee just ignored the evidence

Oh, chariot swing low
Come to take another young angel home
Underneath that February moon
Another young brother gone way to soon

So Zimmerman goes free and the country cries
'Cause we're still shackled by the hatred and the lies
Now we gotta stick together to see justice done
March out of the darkness to the risin' sun

Oh, chariot swing low
Come to take another young angel home
Underneath that February moon
Another young brother gone way to soon

Oh, chariot swing low
Come to take another young angel home
Underneath that February moon
Another young brother gone way to soon

Capitan Presente,MezzoSangue,2012,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mezzosangue/capitanpresente.html,"Già lo sai il nome è MezzoSangue
Da capitan futuro, mister capitan presente

'Sta merda non c'ha faccia, sto col passamontagna
Perché sotto c'è chiunque abbia un motivo per cantarla
E' in nome di chi sbaglia, chi sogna, chi taglia, chi squaia
Degli italiani, non di questa Italia
Traccia il tuo sentiero ma lontano da sta terra
Poi vai dritto, il capitalismo uccide ciò che afferra
Un'arte si fa moda, l'informazione guerra
E tu che ancora accendi la TV, piscia quella merda
In nome di ogni bimbo, stretto in un limbo, morto piano
Ha perso l'innocenza in una stanza in vaticano
E ora è all'inferno? Non dirmi 'ste cazzate, vacci piano padre
Dio ripudia il fatto che lei sia un essere umano
Quanti uguali a lei.. questa roba li sputtana
Questa è Street CNN, ispirata a Fight The Power
È in nome di chi paga col sudore i vostri vizi
Lavora 12 ore al giorno paga i tuoi indennizzi
Presidente, l'Italia è delle banche o della gente?
Diglielo che sei un tecnico obbediente (Bilderberg)
È divertente che nessuno sappia un cazzo
Che ognuno paghi un debito che non ha mai contratto
Ed è eterno, si estende ad un tranello
Tanto contro i sogni c'hanno messo il manganello
Finché quei bastardi c'hanno in mano uno stipendio
Neanche una scintilla di speranza darà vita a un giusto incendio
Qua c'è solo il peggio ed è per sempre
Chi di voi mi ascolta? Chi invece mi sente?
Io sto qua, v'aspetto in piazza il 5 novembre..
Nessun capitan futuro, voglio un capitan presente
Nessun capitan futuro, voglio un capitan presente

They be like when you gonna stop?
Never, till I'm sitting on top
All I know is that green light
Gotta pull off my whole block
Reporting live from the bottom of the map
Riding with a 30 shot clip, bodies all neck
Don't be reckless, don't test us,
I'll put you on my checklist
You feeling lucky today? Then I can make your death wish
Hard body, we wreck them up,
Scarred body, I'll tear it up
Aim for the nose, hit his eyes, slick, rick, patch him up
My young niggas be acting up,
Check niggas, that's acting tough
Ball for ball, I'm sick with that fire,
Who's gonna match 'em up?
Nobody, I'm so Gotti, I whack niggas with no problem
Red in my pocket groin, I ain't never havin dope problems

So don't be asking me to hang a curtain rail for you, because
The screwdriver business just gets me confused
It takes me half an hour to change a fuse
And when I flicked the switch, the lights all blew

I'm not your handyman

Don't be expecting me to put up shelves or build a garden shed
But I can write a song that tells the world how much I love you instead
I'm not any good at pottery so let's lose the 't' and just shift back the 'e'
And I'll find a way to make my poetry build a roof over our heads

I know it looks like I'm just reading the paper
But these ideas I'll turn to gold dust later
'Cause I'm a writer, not a decorator

I'm not your handyman

Let It Spill,Los Campesinos!,2013,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/loscampesinos/letitspill.html,"I was born atop a Winter's hill, I took form as a ball in the virgin snow
that started on its slow descent, barely more than 27 years ago.
And every ounce my love has grown, I absorbed another flake,
when this avalanche has hit, imagine the mess I will make.

A tidal wave from the tears. Will you toil in the garden to dig a well,
deep to the core of the earth? They'll sob enough to douse all the fires of hell.
I see you with shovel in hand, your skirt billows above your knees,
envy the soil that fills their pores and this perverted breeze.

And I'm full to the brim
Pull me up to your mouth
Let it spill, let it spill
And I'm full to the brim
Flood the North to the South
Let it spill, let it spill
all over us two
I take no solace in coastal breezes cos the quay is sea minor without you

Béla Guttmann of love, curse all my exes to a life of celibacy
and then while you freed the doves, I shot them from the sky for taxidermy.
An every day disaster, a bread and butter tragedy,
I sunk an oil tanker off the shores of Galillee.

Cheers To You,Tim Hicks,2013,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/timhicks/cheerstoyou.html,"Daddy fought fires in our small town, 
40 years risking his life
And mama she worried every night
Grand daddy worked every job in that factory
Yeah, a lot of work for a little pay, 
But he held his head high everyday
Said son this country,
Was built on hard work and faith

Here's to the rough necks, the teachers 
The truckers on the long haul, 
The farmers sweating in the sun, 
Getting it done, 
Yeah, here's to you all.

How bout a holler for the blue collared men and women working over time
Hey thank you for doing all you do
Cheers to you

Yeah you teach our kids how to read and write, 
You keep our little town safe at night, 
You build us our cars, and keep em running 
You wear steel dagger star
You're the heart and backbone
Of this small & free country, 
Built on handwork and faith

2013 (Accendila),Gemitaiz,2013,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gemitaiz/2013accendila.html,"2013, finalmente ho fatto un disco (vai)
Adesso nelle tue classifiche esisto
Dicevano: ""Fake, il tuo rap non lo capisco""
Adesso mi chiedono: ""Ti dispiace se ti intervisto?""(scusa)
Nah, non mi dispiace, anzi insisto!
Così ti spiego perché questo prodotto è in acquisto (eh)
Dopo averne regalati più della somma della discografia degli artisti che preferisco (eeh)
10 anni con gli occhi visti, è solo per farti capire
Quante sudate mi sono sbattuto, mai avuto nient'altro da dire
24, 7, 3-6-5 per non restare fottuto
Che da quando ho abbandonato gli studi
Non ho mai abbandonato lo studio (mai)
Pensavi che facessi il disco per le radio? (ah)
M'hanno bendato insieme agli scheletri nell'armadio
Frà guerrafondaio, rappo la merda al contrario
Una nube d'erba e scompaio, volano in sella ad un mortaio (Gemitaiz)
Una canna che ti fa il triplo
Di venti gocce di Rivotril, tre litri come Timothy
Manda a casa i pupazzi che ti spacciano per idoli
Che ho capito la fine dopo i primi 2 capitoli
Questi vogliono il sangue (sangue)
Perché è quello che vende (vende)
A me basta un rullante
E vedi Cristo che scende! (ah)
Dirai: ""Ecco ha cominciato con l'auto-celebrazione""
Provaci te a fargli capire le cose a questa nazione (ciao)
Outsider stanco, stato anni nel fango (nel fango)
Puoi chiamarmi Django, perché quando hanno capito che potevo farlo
È stato come quando hanno visto la prima volta un negro a cavallo
Non rappo degli alieni sull'Ouf (nah)
Metto a tempo i miei teoremi sul caos
Rimango nel disagio che sembra Animal House
Scrivo questa in albergo e poi muoio Gemy Winehouse
Ciao

It All Began With A Burst,Kishi Bashi,2013,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kishibashi/itallbeganwithaburst.html,"Kesa ka ni sasareta

And the source was your laughter
Threw me off the wall
Used your face as a mascot
And the medicine came after
Left in a sprawl
Many miles from Cessna

Kesa ka ni sasareta

One of many in the mess hall
Family there and all
Making money on the desktop
Was at war with fast cars
Many chemicals in the eyes of The Master
Burst!
(master in every way)

Kesa ka ni sasareta

For the love of the soft game
Made of models set in plaster
When in doubt of the last year
Gather all your fear and
Dip your hand in the blender
Burst!

In your wallet was your gender
Stolen when in Rome
In the shadow of your blender
Was a secret of the bedroom
Blemish in the chrome
In the eye of the bender

(chiku)
Kesa ka ni sasareta

It All Began With Burst now
Every several months
And the chemicals came after
It was a race to be faster
Quicker than the worst
In the style of The Master

Mermaids,Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,2013,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickcavethebadseeds/mermaids.html,"She was a catch
We were a match
I was the match
That would fire up her snatch
But there was a catch
I was no match
I was fired from her crotch
Now I sit around and watch
The mermaids sun themselves
Out on the rocks
They are beyond our touch
I watch and watch
Them wave at me
They wave at me
They wave and slip
Back into the sea

All the ones who come
And all the ones who go
Down to the water
All the ones who come
And all the ones who go
Down to the sea

I believe in God
I believe in mermaids too
I believe in seventy two virgins
On a chain why not why not
I believe in the rapture
For I've seen your face
On the floor of the ocean
At the bottom of the rain

I do driver alertness course
I do husband alertness course
I do mermaid alertness course
I watch them out on the rocks
They wave at me
They wave at me
They wave and slip
Back into the sea

All the ones who come
And all the ones who go
Down to the water
All the ones who come
And the ones who go
Down to the sea

She was a little girl picked in the school
Yeah she had funny teeth, all the kids called her tooth head
Years later when her ma got sicked, she did everything she could, but mama won't rich
She didn't stop, worked hard different jobs yeah
Dad put her through community college
Waitress, retail, hot dog on a stair
Telling herself daddy wanted her like this
Now she the boss, she the boss, she the boss
You see her writing up, can you know what it cost
Now she the one with the smile on her face
Cause no one gave her to you, she earned that feeling

Come on come on
Now you feeling like a pimp, you got everything you want, no wonder

I'm on top of the world, top of the world

Now she wanna find love, but she can?
Somebody who can hold her, better serenade
But she's a little hard cloak with the pros, could be goodbye goodbye before it's hello hello
Before you say a word, better hold your breath
Sitting with mine, if you have it ooh
I'm in sometime, but she's a lifestyle
I got a big head but my baby is a hot ride

Baby on top of it, baby on top of it, baby, she's on top of it
Baby on top of it

Yeah sometimes that's just how it goes

Now she well paid first class top grade go to sleep by herself only with the front page
Dreaming of a one then she ain't got yet
That's somebody to hold when the sun sets
She starts thinking of peers, just to feel good, it's harder not to be what she wants
What else just keep it real, but she remember how tough it was to get her
She can't be so hard on herself yet,
You need a good time baby girl let it go
You need a good time baby girl let it go
You still so young, good times, let it go
You still so young, good times, let it go

Wondering if the lords really watching cause
If he is then tell me why I've been going through hell
Lately and I just don't feel like heavens an option
Look, I feel the guilt pouring in
I wonder if he feels my pain
Cause everyday its getting more intense
Moms could barely afford the rent
Had to do some shady shit to survive
But I just hope the lord forgives
Is he forgiving like they say he is
Is there anyway away from this
Is there even anyplace where kids go when they pass away
I heard somebody say there is
But I don't know who to trust no more
And grandma said I really shouldn't cuss no more
But I just tell her ""I'mma try"" and knowing I'mma stay the same
I try to change so many times, I can't adjust no more

Shit, but father when will I see more smiles and frowns
Where do I go when I'm buried deep in the ground
Father why is the world never holding me up
I feel like I'm always letting you down
I feel like I'm always letting you down

I feel like I'm always letting you down
I often wonder bout who I'm a disappointment to
But no matter how good you do, they still point at you
Sometimes I don't know how I get through the day
Cause even though you see me smile, it don't mean I'm okay
I just don't wanna be bothered with questions
Father why these cats always causing problems
I've been constantly stressing
Shit, I wonder if he's even listening to me
Searching for answers, but ain't nobody giving em' to me
Plus my girl needs attention, I can feel the tension
My pops is on a drinking binge
And he's on the break of an intervention
But he taught me so much with only his actions
What I learned from him, he would never imagine
If there was something that I would want him to know
Every mistake he made, it was all meant to happen
No time wasted cause I learned from it all
Made me a better man inside, made me learn when I fall
There's always a reason to get back up on your feet
So if you hear me lord, I hope you could answer this for me

Father when will I see more smiles and frowns
Where do I go when I'm buried deep in the ground
Father why is the world never holding me up
I feel like I'm always letting you down
I feel like I'm always letting you down

To purchase and redeem
And reconcile the very ones

Commitment Issues,ASAP Ferg,2014,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/asapferg/commitmentissues.html,"I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
[x3]

Woke up, seen Daddy in bed with another woman
Thought that was Mama, ""hey ma""- hold up, that couldn't
Be her, what I'm thinking, cause she just went to work
It was a naked look-a-like and Daddy there with no skirt
See, Daddy was getting busy when I barged in
Then when I said ""mommy?"", he chuckled and grinned
Then I soon realized that the crust in my eyes
Had the chick looking like Mama love from the side
See, Daddy was a player and I wasn't surprised
He would holla at the girls when we rolled with the guys
Should I hate or embrace these ties?
I mean, I praise this dude, god's sake, he's fly
He couldn't do no wrong in my eyes
But at the same time I hated to see my mama cry
Ain't no wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind

[Hook:]
And I wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
[x4]

I've got commitment issues, did from when I was young
Wasn't tryna fit in my uncle's Timberlands, he was dumb
His shoe was too small to fit my big toe in
Ain't wanna walk in his shoes, he was just hoing
He stayed broke, them bitches provided for him
Whether skinny, fat, black or tyrannosaurus
He was a gigolo, and never minded whoring
Guess the money gave him new ways to ignore it
Pussy is pussy, and new clothes the way he saw it
This ain't Enyce nigga, what she brought in?
To see him kiss her ass made me nauseous
Then he'd give her sloppy hugs like my baby gorgeous
He was just doing that for the new forces
All this fucking bullshit that had my brain distorted
Ain't no wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind

[Hook x4]

I've got commitment issues, even with my craft
Didn't think Willie Lynch was that good at math
Took a lil black baby 'way from mom and dad
Now he lost in the field and it's so sad
The mind of a slave, at a young age
Can't talk to a girl or know how to engage
He think being a gentleman is wrong and gay
But he feel that way cause that's how he was raised
He watched dad diss mom, she got play
And your uncle only had a girl when he got paid
All this shit put my life in a maze
Then when I grow up, marriage in a haze
Ain't no wonder why I can't commit sometimes
Somewhere along down the line, it's affecting my mind
To all the ladies, I'll just say it one more time
Somewhere along down the line, it's affected our minds

Tell em from me that's a blatant lie

Just dont sell out your soul for a price
Don’t lose yourself, I ain't gotta prove myself to no-one, Frisco's certified
More time over my side or your side
Before you can draw yours I'm a draw mine
I dont care if your with four guys
You can bring more guys, more for the 45
Frisco hold the road like a four four drive
You don’t wanna get a box in your jaw side
Vibe can’t die I’m a keep it alive
While I'm alive I'm a keep keeping the vibe
As long as I keep the mic in my right hand I’m keep on keeping it live

When you looking at Skepta, you're looking at the Canary Wharf and the Gherkin
They better mention me when they're talking about London, nigga I'm murking
Sitting in my bedroom, smoking so much weed that my chest is hurting
On a porno website watching a sexy Latina squirting
How can a man owe me money, but when I call him he don't answer my calls?
No less than Section 18 when I catch them fools
I don't care if he's got a screw loose, cause that nigga ain't got no tools
I don't care if he's got a baseball bat, that pussy ain't got no balls
You can't educate me about bagging up food, I'm an old school drug dealer
I walk to the shop in the pouring rain for clingfilm and a Ribena
Took the ball from one ends to the other like Maradona at Argentina
I used to fuck with the light more than the dark fam, I had jungle fever
Nowadays I got so many ladies, with a million complexions
Like Tinie when it comes to G-Shocks, I got a crazy dumb collection
New trainers in my house that I ain't worn since Obama won the election
My flow's so sick MCs trying to find our how I caught the infection

Whoever said money won't change you
Tell em from me that's a blatant lie

But they love me all over the world, cause they say my style is so bilingual
I told them already I'm a star and I don't need a label to make me twinkle
Glinting relentless, thinking ""where the fuck are the fans that bought the single?!""
Knock-knock, who's there? ""Nigga It's"", ""Nigga It's"" who? ""Nigga It's Karma""
My mom told me if anybody punches me in the face, punch them back harder!
Last October I got caught on camera with no balaclava
Now community service are trying to turn Skepta into a gardener
The women at probation wanna know why I see life in one dimension
I'm just trying to be a good man, living in a world full of bad intentions
I pick up the phone and I check my Twitter page
I see the devil in my mentions
I tried to phone God but it's like my nigga ain't got no reception
I really feel like letting some skeletons out the wardrobe, can I get a witness?
I want to say so much but I know business is business
And now that I'm on a playlist, I'm not trying to get put back on the hitlist
Back in the streets of North London, dipping in and out of tea with a biscuit
Frisco

[Hook - Frisco:]
Whoever said money won't change you
Tell em from me that's a blatant lie
I ain't gonna lie, 'course it will change you
Just dont sell out your soul for a price
Don’t lose yourself, I ain't gotta prove myself to no-one, Frisco's certified
More time over my side or your side
Before you can draw yours I'm a draw mine
I dont care if your with four guys
You can bring more guys, more for the 45
Frisco hold the road like a four four drive
You don’t wanna get a box in your jaw side
Vibe can’t die I’m a keep it alive
While I'm alive I'm a keep keeping the vibe
As long as I keep the mic in my right hand I’m keep on keeping it live

Bitch On The Run,"Fish, Samantha",2015,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/samanthafish/bitchontherun.html,"Laws of men, money is king
You needed help but the phone don't ring
You got your wife, you got your car
Just keep your kids outta the front yard
Got you feeling like a dog in heat
Working you like a piece of meat
Hear the sirens in my neighborhood
We'd laugh it off if the story's good

Right now, right now I'm feeling it
Breathin' the smoke after the damage is done
Right now, right now I'm dealing it
Another bitch on the run

Can't trust my TV set
It's screaming things I'd like to forget
World's on fire, it's burnin' down
Move the channel as it comes to town
Boys will be boys, it's a powerful thing
Better learn how to swim or learn how to drink
Cops and robbers, I can't tell 'em apart
It's a systematic figure that we're passing as art

Right now, right now I'm feeling it
Breathin' the smoke after the damage is done
Right now, right now I'm dealing it
Another bitch on the run, hey

Right now, right now I'm feeling it
Breathin' the smoke after the damage is done
Right now, right now I'm dealing it

Bad Habits,FIDLAR,2015,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fidlar/badhabits.html,"Well they say I gotta habit
That I'm just a drug addict
And I'll never be nothing more

Well they can just have it
I don't care if I'm damaged
Honestly I just think I'm bored

And alcohol is just a flavour
That I wanna try and savour
Every second that I'm on tour

I'm gonna do what I want
I don't care if it's not
What you want anymore

So now I'm drinkin' Coca-Cola
With some whiskey and a soda
I've been sippin' since 10am

And every morning I wake up
I just wanna give up
But I guess I gotta deal with it

Oh my god, it's like
BOO-FUCKING-HOO
It's just all about you
And man you're so sensitive
And do you really think that I
Wanna be that guy
That dies without any friends

But don't go so sentimental now
I've got my whole life to figure it out
I'm gettin' older and I'm freakin' out
'Cos I got nothing to show
And I'm still fucking broke

But I got bad habits
Yeah they're my bad habits
And all I got are bad habits
But they're my bad habits

And now I'm one week sober
And I'm still hungover
And maybe I should take a break

And I think I need help
'Cos I'm playing with myself
At least three times a day

And what's the big-fuckin-deal
If I don't wanna feel
But I got some reservations about rehabilitation

'Cos I drink 'til I'm mad
And I love being sad
OH MY GOD I'M BECOMING MY DAD

I got bad habits
Yeah they're my bad habits
And all I got are bad habits
But they're my bad habits
And all I got are bad habits
But they're my bad habits
And all I want are bad habits
Yeah my bad habits...

Every second that
Every second that
I wanna try and
I don't care if it's not care if it's not

I wanna try and
I wanna try and
I wanna try and
I wanna try and

I don't care if it's not
I don't care if it's not

I'm On It,"Meekins, Cam",2015,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/cammeekins/imonit.html,"While y'all dreamed I was getting it on
Smoking the green and I'm singing the song
And I'm on it
And I'm on it
[x2]

I don't know what was better my first spliff or my first kiss
Picture perfect paintin' pictures of when I first did
Rap sessions just reflecting life as a adolescent
I was stressing asking questions god will teach me a lesson
Need them bottles pouring but I don't even drink a lot
I was stuck in my mind but I don't need to think a lot
We were having conversations about our lifestyle
What you wanna be, I said I wanna be right now
My perspective should of kept it bottled up
I'm connecting to the death and my reflection hot enough
In the mirror it get clearer and I'm here to light em up
Rolling roaches cause I'm posted and proceed to get high as.. fuck
And I'm blitzed thinking bout meanings of this
Palms clutching heart racing I'm the meanest in this bitch
Nobody else can flow like me
Better yet I go in politely
Your hoe she blow up my phone but I know I gotta let her go lightly
I'm trying to be the best in my city
B town they fuckin with me
Whether I'm in New York or Cali
I gotta get it in like she pretty
Well my phone 617, gotta rep it til I die
Who am I
Realest mother fucker alive lets get high
I'm gone

While y'all dreamed I was getting it on
Smoking the green and I'm singing the song
And I'm on it
And I'm on it
[x2]

I need more money more bitches
More drugs and more trippin'
Cause I've been stage diving I need more hundred row pics in
I'm so into gold wrists'
I might just cop two
Already got the dark beamer
Next one might go blue
Gasin up like I'm Texaco
Bury you like flexico
And they said I couldn't make it but your girl say I'm next to blow
I don't even text her though
I had to just smash it and I ain't seen the gymnastics but I know that she flexible
It's a lamp City thang
A lamp City thang
They never said that I would make it now I'm top of my game
We hit it off in the back and I ain't even know her name
Shout out to all the rappers thinking that I'm gonna fade
I made this beat in my studio
Ain't loving these groupie hoes
I ain't playing no games these rappers stay playing Yu-Gi-Oh
There's so many cameras better yet this life is bananas
And I get that I'm like the Celtics by the way that I be gettin these banners
She say she a model
Ain't worried bout tomorrow
She might be a bird but I still follow follow follow
She say she smoke and she drank
I said it ain't a problem
Cause I just ordered some shots
And we solve em solve em solve em

While y'all dreamed I was getting it on
Smoking the green and I'm singing the song
And I'm on it

My girl is the baddest, we do it with passion
The music is blasting, my view is fantastic
Yeah, I'm on a wave, but I do not surf
My balcony feel like it's right on the edge of the Earth
So maybe I'll learn, the water is blue
My pockets are green, the sunset is yellow
We shop on Rodeo, we shoot on the rim with the team
Trust me it is what it seems, we living a dream
Move to LA and we killing the scene
Every athlete they come through the city for bitches
And liquor, they hitting up me, bitch, I'm a G

A Place In The Woods,Twiztid,2015,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/twiztid/aplaceinthewoods.html,"Stay out!

[Monoxide:]
You couldn’t see the clearing from the road
So, alone I sit, my legs folded and eyes closed
This is the place that I go
To come to grips that my sanity’s juxtaposed
With insanity, overload
And I’m afraid of my soul
When I’m back here, I’m all alone
There ain’t no screaming for help
When you're gone, they’ll never know

[Jamie Madrox:]
All the way to the drowning
Heavy stick in my hand and my heart, it keeps pounding
I'm holding them under
And their faces turn blue and I'm watching for wonder
See I hunt them like wild lions
And I catch em and kill em and cut em with hunting knife
Taxidermy like Mormons, stuff their body with leaves and replace vital organs
The thing that's important, is to never dispose of the edible organs
Delicious and morbid like a bucket of blood and a handful of organs
A place in the woods, where no one will hear you dying or seeing you live again
Rest here, you're home now, I'll keep you here with all of them

[Hook:]
Sometimes when you look in the woods, the woods... Look back
""I don't like to be-"" there's no one in the…
I am the woods
Do you believe in the devil?
I- I shouldn't of gone in there
Stop going there, -do you go in there for?
""Hey, stay out of the woods!""

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
Off in the shadows on darkest of nights
There stands the heartless, his targets in sight
Underbrush overgrown, death stays hidden
Moss growth camouflage, body parts missin'
Trophy collection connected to the prize
Like to hear em scream, always look em in the eyes
Where my disguise is the face of a victim
Get excited everytime I knife sticks em
Watch em die in a place in the woods, the sensation feel so good
Drag em to the cabin, singing and laughing
Addicted to the feelin', so appealin' is the killin'

[Hook]

[Jamie Madrox:]
I'm taking them antlers, night is black as a panther
Lost in the rapture as I torture the victim I've captured
No hearin' the screams of me stabbin' behind, on the side of vacational cabins
There’s darkly shadows somewhere deep in woods where I have them
Tall trees, and the leaves they love the breeze
It’s so peaceful and secluded with horror you can’t believe
The begger repeating ""please"", broken down upon your knees
Hands quiver, come now bleed out until it reds the streets

[Monoxide:]
They wanna get up inside of my head, never
I don't care what the doctors said
In the woods with a bag full of smoke for cover
It just makes me feel better, just keeping it real when I
Tell you not to go in the woods
Cause I’m back there and I will sever
Head from neck, put em in a hole
And I call the show cause it’s dug fresh
Anything left, dig another hole
And burn that shit like I’m learnin' it
Crime scene tight like a tourniquet
In the woods I’m on my murder shit
Love to watch the blood squirt a bit
Just cover it up with the dirt like this

Winter,Tim Bendzko,2016,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/timbendzko/winter.html,"Der Wind reißt die letzten Blätter von den Bäumen
Jetzt irren sie ziellos umher
Schneebedeckt - den asphaltierten Weg
Frierende Hände in den Taschen
Kein Blick mehr fürs Detail
Alle Spuren lautlos weggeweht

Woran soll man glauben
Wenn die Liebe nichts taugt ?
Wo ist die Zuversicht
Wenn man sie braucht ?
Wie kann man verbergen
Dass das Herz gefriert ?
Der Winter ist hier

Bin so merkwürdig abgestumpft
Adrenalin in Ketten aus Blei
Der Winter spielt das falsche Lied
Versuch die letzten Sonnestrahlen einzufangen
Mal den Himmel in Gedanken blau
Ich muss kämpfen
Ich darf die Hoffnung nicht verlieren

Woran soll man glauben
Wenn die Liebe nichts taugt ?
Wo ist die Zuversicht
Wenn man sie braucht ?
Wie kann man verbergen

High Road,Alexx Calise,2016,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alexxcalise/highroad.html,"It can hurt far worse
To do the right thing
Sometimes to build, you must destroy

Some may have things
To say about you
At least you can look at yourself

Come a day when 
This will all end 
Sun will shine through the clouds
Our decisions
Are what make us
Don’t forget who you are

Gotta take the high road
Yea I know its less traveled
And although it may seem so, you’re not alone

Wish you weren’t 
Born with a conscience
Seems its more trouble than it’s worth

So hard to stay true 
The world’s against you
Now here is where you earn your wings

Come a day when 
This will all end 
Sun will shine through the clouds
Our decisions
Are what make us
Don’t forget who you are

Gotta take the high road
Yea I know its less traveled
And although it may seem so, you’re not alone

Live through this
Come out stronger
Oh, be the better man
Now show the world just what you’re worth 

Gotta take the high road
Yea I know its less traveled
And although it may seem so, you’re not alone

Crossroads (The Love Affair' Sailing Theme),"Pangilinan, Michael",2016,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/michaelpangilinan/crossroadstheloveaffairsailingtheme.html,"You came into my life unexpectedly
Without even knowing it you we're slowly
Making a place in my heart
You gave my life a brand new start
You we're making a place in my heart
You gave my life a brand new start

Crossroads
This is where I stand
Should I go back
Or should I take a chance

I'm living in the present
But my mind is stucked in the past
Not knowing what I'll lose
Not knowing what will last

A memory that's still in my heart
Even though we're far apart
A memory that's still in my heart
And I wish you well with your brand new start

Crossroads
This is where I stand
Should I go back
Or should I take a chance

Crossroads
Tough to face tomorrow
Without you here today
I'm in deep sorrow

I'm standing in the middle of nowhere
Hoping deep in your heart
You know how much I care

No matter where you go
No matter how near or far who knows
I wish you well with your brand new start
I wish you well with your brand new start

Crossroads
This is where I stand
Should I go back
Or should I take a chance

Crossroads
This is where we are
Just hold tight
Forever's not too far

Crossroads
This is not the end
I'll met you where we can begin again

She'll always know
That I love to run so well but I need to go
You and I were born and I'll make you make your mind up

Nothing in the world that will make you make your mind up
If I had a choice I'll wait to find
Nothing in your eyes will tell me where you'll lie

World Is Mine,ASAP Ferg,2016,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/asapferg/worldismine.html,"[Intro - A$AP Ferg & Big Sean:]
Yeah
Better get the fuck out my face
You always telling me I got the world
Talking all that shit
Bitch you better the fuck out my face
But I don't have half of what I want to achieve
Na-na-na-na, fuck is you saying
I got to get it

[Chorus x2 - Big Sean:]
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
I know that ain't true
And even though I want it all
I'm young, man, and I got everything to lose
I'm young, man, and I got everything to lose
I'm young, man, and I got everything to lose
I'm young, man, and I got everything to lose
I'm young, man, and I got everything to lose

[Verse 1 - A$AP Ferg:]
She tried to tell me that the world is mine
But you know it ain't true, you know it ain't true
I'm tryna make a dollar, get my ass up out of Harlem
Cause you know the haters watching and the bullets ain't cool
Ain't you, attracted to a powerful motherfucker
Don't wanna be compared to these other dudes, motherfucker
Who turning so passionate when they battling motherfuckers
But never get a crib up in Malibu motherfucker
And I don't want to wind up like him
Be careful, that time fold, you won't let them in
Grinding that old food, no AC or fan
No trips to Jamaica, babe you gets no tan
I wanna pull up pull up in a 4-4 or Benz
A Sprinter van, with TVs in
Your crew jump in, I'm getting those gins
And we get muhfucking high as a kite
You say that this shit mami, cause you my girl
You say you just need me and need no one else
But with your love, ambition, take over the world

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2 - Big Sean:]
Funny how it all go go
You never could know though
What happened to Tiger?
Was Kobe, you know hoes
Get caught in a photo
Lipstick on your polo
And all the trust that you build's right out the door door
Y'all went from lovebirds to looking like do-do's
And that shit gon last, for months it'll go go
And that shit gon drag, drag on like komodo
Over a bitch that look like Quasimodo, God!
Now you calling and checking in, all the time like your ass still on parole though
Wondering if you just better off solo
You paying a price, but is that what it owe though?
Praying up to God about shit that's not even holy
You like she tripping over bitches saying that they know me
Then she put the pussy on me, swear that shit control me
That shit control me, man that shit control me

Stop Me,Christon Gray,2016,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/christongray/stopme.html,"Stop me
Stop me
Stop me

Once upon a time the people pleaser in me would hold back
'Til God said this message is much bigger than rap
Been happening for years, we've seen it across the map
The boomerang flow, me and Tom just brought it back
Preaching at people with no love
Stay looking at sinners with cold shrugs
The like minded get met with warm hugs
Welcome to the circus, it's all good on the surface
If you don't agree then throw a stone
All our houses made out of glass, I'm going home
Thinking who's who it's the attack of the clones
I'm at the final table when cards is being shown
Gotta keep my hands folded
Throw the deuces in, I can't hold em
Schools out, we tired of being scolded
We know the rules, just hate the way that you told 'em

Stop me, stop me
Oh somebody stop me
Stop me, stop me
Please, somebody stop me
Stop me, stop me
Oh, somebody stop me
And Lord if I'm doing it wrong then please stop me
Stop me, Stop me, Stop me
And Lord if I'm doing it wrong then please stop me

Feels like the cold war, but I ain't Russian though
Slowing things down, no concussion bro
And I already know I'm not untouchable
Just tryna give em less Cosby, more Huxtable
Sam sung, the change is gon' come
Watch it on my cell, they beating the same drum
Over crowded cells, in chains they can't run
It's 50 years later, where the change coming from
God said love your neighbor like you love yourself
But when a man wants a man then he's on the shelf
She say she feel like a man and just wants some help
I guess it's easier to love em when it's someone else
So I apologize for the Paul disguise
We been wearing without solving the Saul inside
We don't mean no harm, we here to harmonize
Sound the alarm, it's time to cross the line

Stop me, stop me
Oh somebody stop me
Stop me, stop me
Please, somebody stop me
Stop me, stop me
Oh, somebody stop me
And Lord if I'm doing it wrong then please stop me
Stop me, Stop me, Stop me
And Lord if I'm doing it wrong then please stop me

I think it's time for me to turn the mirror round
I don't like what I see, I'm double blinking now
Visine, I mean it's getting clearer now
The devil keeps talking, should I hear him out?
I'm fighting to believe I'm free
Neo sparring with Morpheus, look where I bleed
Stings like a bee, I ain't their Ali
People funnel the cake, the only fair I see
One for the money, two for the show
I do it for free if my grass will still grow
If I don't do it for three then who do I do it for (four)
I'm wrestling like Jacob
Wondering what I'm made of
Everyday that I wake up, I'm feeling less cushion
The logo's a button, I been wanting you to push it
Standing at the edge, staring at the ground
Tryna keep my focus, it's a long way down so

Stop me, stop me
Oh somebody stop me
Stop me, stop me
Please, somebody stop me
Stop me, stop me
Oh, somebody stop me
And Lord if I'm doing it wrong then please stop me
Stop me, Stop me, Stop me
And Lord if I'm doing it wrong then please stop me

Never around, I was never around

Another minute of my life gone by
My time flies
Well I'll sleep 'til I arrive

Slow down, don't break down
Slow down, on the verge of a breakdown
Slow down, don't break down
Slow down, don't break down

What a life to live
What a strange little gift
Won't chase another dream but
It's not as easy as it seems
Where are we bound?
Always missing out
My time flies
Well I'll sleep 'til I arrive

Slow down, don't break down

It was us against the world, but now

Feels like eternity, and I can’t believe

I let you in, you left me out
You left me on my own, you left me all alone
I let you in, you bled me out
You left me skin and bone, you left me all alone

You left me all alone

I would’ve gave it all
Truth be told I can’t believe you’re gone
Like a dream I can’t recall
Now I gotta face the fact that you’re never coming back

I’ll leave the light on

Don't Let Me Love,Dreamcar,2017,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dreamcar/dontletmelove.html,"I sat in the church so I might pray
To remain set in
My evil ways

If you see me waver
Just give me a shove
I'll let you take off the edge
Just please
Don't let me love

You wore a white dress as you embraced
A Strasberg method
On trying days
I unlaced my boots then stayed outside
You said, ""Oh, don't be silly. Your kind of tracks you cannot hide.""

Just give me a shove

El Chicken Little,Roberto Tapia,2017,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/robertotapia/elchickenlittle.html,"Historias ya tengo varias y junto con mi plebada con la
Camisa fajada siempre apoyando a la gente y al señor de la montaña

Me la navego en la Hidalgo con los puntos controlados
Todo el terre bien cuidado
Si se acercan los del agua mi gente pronto me avisa
Nunca espero a que se acerquen,
Con gobierno no pelemos sólo con las otras clicas

Don Joaquín ""El Chapo"" nos dejó mucho
Encargado que el pueblo esté bien cuidado
Su palabra respetamos, sus consejos los tomamos
Muchas gracias por su apoyo,
Aquí todos lo extrañamos y con gusto lo esperamos

Una infacia muy obstara siempre a mí
Me acompañaba, fui amigo de la pobreza
En mi mente ya tenía todo lo que yo quería éste sería
Mi destino arriesgando yo mi vida pa'ayudar a mi familia

La cosecha que levantas es la
Semilla que siembras, pónganse muy abusados
Ahora que cayó el señor son varios que se voltearon pero ya están en
La lista y también les va un recado:
Que pronto regresa ""El Chapo""

Aquí nada te regalan las cosas aquí
Se ganan, éste puesto me ha costado
Yo soy puro Culiacán,
No se les vaya a olvidar a la
Empresa que yo apoyo son los Guzmán Salazar
Con ellos hasta el final

Hoodwinker,Enter Shikari,2017,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/entershikari/hoodwinker.html,"This is the voice of God
You've got it, you've got it
Stay in and lock your doors

I don't care what you've achieved
There's only one location if you don't follow me

You're gonna burn in a blistering furnace
From now until forever, no matter how it ends
(You always get what you wanted)

Halt, freeze
Who goes there?
Do you have the right, do you have the right documentation?
Stop, wait
This ain't right
This is fraudulent, this is counterfeit
You are a hoodwinker, sir

This is the voice of God
The shrink-wrapper of minds
Stay in, lock your doors

To the three thousand
Other gods
In every age the priest has been hostile to liberty
Burning books
It's mental captivity

Gros j'ai passé mon temps dans la stup
Les ients-cli j'les ai vus arriver au loin

Et je sais que pour eux j'suis leur pire cauchemar
De quoi ont-ils peur ?
Touche à un des mes gars, on va revenir le soir même
Beaucoup trop d'acteurs
J'ai LDS, pas besoin qu'on m'aime
Evidemment que je me calme à la verdure
Comment être propre ? J'suis entouré d'ordures
Ma cité vit de la vente de la drogue dure
Nos rues sont sales, y'a des seringues à terre
Et j'pourrais jamais oublier mes gars qui m'poussent
Mouty, Dams, on les baise tous
On sort pas en te-boî, vitre teintée de Grey Goose
Ma belle t'es douce, comme mon shit tu m'étouffes

J'en ai vu qui faisaient les miss vierges
Au final elle faisaient le grand écart
On m'a dit que la nuit porte conseil
Donc j'ai fini par rentrer tard

J'suis grave chaud, tu m'guettes mal, j'te démolis
J'les frappe un par un mais avant j'les aligne
T'auras pas 1 euro même si tu es maline
A partir de 23 heures j'm'arrête pas au feu
Tu sais qu'tu leur donnes de la force quand tu parles d'eux ?
Je n'fume pas mais pour ton birthday j'en fume deux
Tu t'crois lourd c'est que t'as pas écouté Morphine 2
Je ne suis pas un exemple, parfois je fume de la drogue

Room For 2,Dua Lipa,2017,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dualipa/roomfor2.html,"Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

Why are you blaming me for all your insecurities?
I never did anything, but you closed the doors
Slammed shut on me
Something a little bit bitter that should've been sweet
I won't compete
You're like a king with a crown looking down
Hoping I want it

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock

Up and down, it all comes back around

Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

Remember what it felt like to start the climb
I'm just like you
Maybe you'll better with time and we'll leave it behind
There's room for 2
You should've never done something like that to someone
You can't undo
Thought you were under the radar
But under the chaos I see through

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock

I hope that one day you will change
See, everyone ain't the same
We're more than machines
You saw a spark where there wasn't a flame
And you barely remember my name
Do you feel complete?

Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock
You'll come tumblin' down

Solstice,Gaël Faye,2017,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gaelfaye/solstice.html,"Now Stackerlee, Lord, and Billy Lyon
They were gamblin' early one day
Stackerlee losin' money
And he throwed the cards away
Now Stackerlee, he told Billy Lyon
“Billy, I’m sho' gonna take yo' life”
Now Stackerlee, Lord, and Billy Lyon
They were gamblin' early one day

Knowledge of the infinite
Even if you got it just a little bit
Soon as you feel the ground start shaking
All your doubts and fears start waking
Baby cries through the concrete
Genocide, lost the breath of life under Gods feet
Genocide of the angels
Even murdered instruments, trumpets, banjos
But I still hear singing
Mixed between the crying
Sirens ringing
Buried my whole tribe
I'm crying, thinking
Rescue us from Zion
God ain't blinking
Bodies, how they pile on
Clock ain't ticking
On face had a smile on
Plot just thickened
Courage of a lion, nine-life kitten
Wandering through iron bars, once prison

Now Stackerlee, Lord, and Billy Lyon
They were gamblin' early one day
Stackerlee losin' money
And he throwed the cards away
Now Stackerlee, he told Billy Lyon
“Billy, I’m sho' gonna take yo' life”
Now Stackerlee, Lord, and Billy Lyon
They were gamblin' early one day

Ils comprennent rien les soumis, les idiots, les vulgaires
A la tristesse de l'Eden, aux clartés de l'Enfer
Il faut goûter son sang car le sang est esprit
On suicide un silence en accouchant d'un cri
J'habite un désastre sous la colère des Dieux
Où le monde doit s'éteindre pour qu'on ouvre les yeux
Et le vin à la bouche, et le coeur sous le pieu
On fera voeu de renaître de quelques cendres de feu
J'effeuille les corolles de ce qu'on veut de la vie
Un peu de vent sur la peau, les caresses d'une fille
S'envolaient tout là haut pour gratter l'équinoxe
Etre un arbre écrivain en s'écorchant l'écorce
Mais tout ça s'est cassé en un éclair, coincé
Sous une chape de béton armé
Mes enfants, le solstice c'est dans longtemps
Mais longtemps c'est maintenant

Before I Go,Xavier Rudd,2018,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/xavierrudd/beforeigo.html,"Before I go can I hold you close?
'Cause your light fills up my soul
And it's hard to explain the reasons why
Why I just need you by my side

Framed in the doorway by the first morning light
Heart was heavy, bags by his side
She look over, she was trying hard to hide
That hollow feeling she felt inside

Before I go can I hold you close?
'Cause your light fills up my soul
And it's hard to explain the reasons why
Why I just need you by my side

There's time to walk away, there was nothing left to say
She allowed that tear to finally trickle down her face
He turned and tipped his hat, said, ""Angel, now you be safe,
There ain't nothing ever gonna take your place.""

Before I go can I hold you close?
'Cause your light fills up my soul
And it's plain to see on these lonely nights
Why I just need you by my side

Sometimes you feel down when it rains
And you see the colors change
And the rainbow guides you home

Can I hold you close?
'Cause that's the safest place I've ever known
And it's plain to see on these lonely nights
Why I just need you by my side

Nothing But The Truth(Deluxe Edition Bonus Track),Rosanne Cash,2018,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rosannecash/nothingbutthetruth.html,"We've loved each other longer now than the falling trees
That stood up through revolution and grew out of our need
But we're called to be much stronger now on days as bright as these
When nothing shades our eyes against this darkest mysteries

Time is a line we stumble and crawl
A perilous dream where both of us fall
Time is a shadow we venture upon
An ocean together we cross like a pond
On our way

Under the false ceiling of all we said and did
We stood away both hearts and hope like they were safe as [?]
Thief may live among us, put tumbles every [?]
But no wheels finding motion take shelter from the road

Time is a line we stumble and crawl
A perilous dream where both of us fall
Time is a lantern held out in the rain
A river that rose like a runaway train
On our way

Now our story wanders a long way from the page
We kiss behind the curtain that falls on every stage
Memories won't be reconciled with promises past due
But still I promise everything and nothing but the truth

Time is a line we stumble and crawl
A perilous dream where both of us fall
Time is a mirror made deeper by light
With every good morning
Good morning
Good night

To tell you what I'm seeing, it's heavy on my brain now
It's only moving faster, you're only sinking farther
I see it in your eyes now, it's only getting harder

There's a house she doesn't know that you take care of
There's a light she doesn't know that you keep on
There's a ""sorry"" that you faked to keep her happy
When she thinks she hasn't seen you in so long
There are things that she's not able to remember
So I took tonight to put it in a song
That when she meets God, He'll tell her all about it
When my mother was a mother to her mom

Conversations with the devil and he's telling me
What's the point in making memories when you can't even find 'em when you're 70?
Conversations with my father and he's telling me
There's a point in making memories 'cause they'll be even better when we're heavenly

There's a house she doesn't know that you take care of
There's a light she doesn't know that you keep on
There's a ""sorry"" that you faked to keep her happy
When she thinks she hasn't seen you in so long
There are things that she's not able to remember
So I took tonight to put it in a song
That when she meets God, He'll tell her all about it

Up from the dust
Inconceivable lie

To protect the way I'm feeling
'Cause I wanna get closer, I wanna get close to you
If instead I cause problems
Don't worry, we can solve them
'Cause I wanna get closer, I wanna get close

All day, you've got me always
Even when I'm away
All you ever have to do is ask

To My Dearest Wife,Lucero,2018,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lucero/tomydearestwife.html,"Waitin' on the sunrise, I've given up on sleep
My only thoughts are with you all back home in Tennessee
They're dug in on the hilltop, we got cover in the trees
Between the two, an open field that looks like hell to me

And to my dearest wife I write
Kiss our baby girls tonight
Tomorrow's battle will not wait
But I don't see no other way

I can see the old house not too long ago
Every night I slept by your side, heaven just bein' home
Can hear 'em callin' Reveille, I can see the sun
It breaks my heart we're kept apart, still fightin' to be done

To my dearest wife I write
Kiss our baby girls tonight
Tomorrow's battle will not wait
But I don't see no other way

Mine eyes have seen the glory
The glory of the comin' of the Lord
And he is tramplin' out the vintage
The vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored

Now the sun is risen, you mean the world to me
My thoughts was turned to work at hand far from Tennessee
They're dug in on the hilltop, we leave the cover of the trees
We'll march across that open field that looks like hell to me

To my dearest wife I write
Kiss our baby girls tonight
Tomorrow's battle will not wait
But I don't see no other way

The bride of war wears blood and fire
Hand-in-hand, death walks beside her
We'll cross the field, lay all to waste
I don't see no other way

To my dearest wife I write
Kiss our baby girls tonight

Elle est bonne comme Bianca
Des envies d’la mettre à quatre pattes
Y’a d’la frappe chez nous en cas
Faire le plan comme Goku

On aime pas la hagra
On est pas des racailles

Pour faire la guerre il faut pas de treillis
Quand c’est la guerre, y’a pas de répit

Restons soudés comme cartel de Cali

Sort le cross même si t’es pas belle
T’es excitante avec ton rouge à lèvre
Elle a vu mon buzz, elle fait plus de manières
J’pète un plomb

Baisse d’un ton
Fait pas le gérant, on veut parler au patron

Like A Battery,Marmozets,2018,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/marmozets/likeabattery.html,"The kids in the street they all know what to do
They're used to it like it ain't nothing new
One day they're gonna run your country too

Baffled by your living conditions
How we left them like this beats me please listen
I don't want a feud, it's rude, it's rude, it's you

I live outside two tower blocks
Filled with people who ran out of luck
But they still get by
It drains me like a battery
We settled for simplicity
But we all get by

Taking it all, taking it all, taking it all from me
Can't you see, can't you see they're struggling
Don't you know they need a break too

Don't look at me like I know what to do
I'm used to it like it ain't nothing new
Karma's gonna find its way back to you

I live outside two tower blocks
Filled with people who ran out of luck
But they still get by
It drains me like a battery
We settled for simplicity
But we all get, all get... high

We all get high

I live outside two tower blocks
Filled with people who ran out of luck
But they still get by
It drains me like a battery
We settled for simplicity
But we all get by

It drains me like a battery
We settled for simplicity
But we all get, we all get by

Alles Probiert,Animus,2018,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/animus/allesprobiert.html,"Ich war lange auf der Flucht vor meinem Ich
Hab' meine Vergangenheit im Keim erstickt
Und jedesmal wenn du bei mir bist, schau' ich dich an
Und frage mich, womit verdiene ich dich eigentlich
Meine Sünden, sie verfolgen mich schon zu viel Jahre
Warten bis ich glücklich bin, um plötzlich zu zuschlagen
Darum haben meine Augen keine Freude mehr
Weil ich bei jedem Lachen daran denk', enttäuscht zu werden
Hast du jemals an irgendwas so fest gehalten
Dass du wusstest, wenn du loslässt, zerfällt dann alles
Diese Angst hab' ich, wenn du in mein'n Arm'n schläfst
Dass ich plötzlich aufwache und mir alles fehlt
Ich weiß, echte Männer sollten niemals Schwäche zeigen
Darum lernte ich, wie ich mit meinem Lächeln weine
Doch egal, wie perfekt mein falsches Lachen klingt
Schaust du mich und weißt sofort, dass was nicht stimmt

Wir haben probiert
Und auch alles riskiert
Doch einer von uns hat schon aufgegeben
Darum kämpfen wir, bis einer seine Maske verliert
Entweder du oder ich, wir haben alles probiert
Und auch alles riskiert
Doch einer von uns hat schon aufgegeben
Darum kämpfen wir, bis einer seine Maske verliert

All die Streitereien der Jahre sind uns anzuseh'n
Ich hab' geschwor'n, dass ich niemals meine Hand erheb'
Dass deine Tränen nie mehr deine Wang'n seh'n
Und dennoch streiten wir so viel, ohne lang zu reden
Schlag' die Faust gegen Wände, es hört niemals auf
Wir machen alles kaputt und bauen's wieder auf
Doch die Risse in der Seele werden immer tiefer
Der Segen unsrer Wohnung, er hängt immer schiefer
Jede Erinnerung Verbitterung
Das Echo unsrer Streitereien im Hintergrund
Die Scherben unsrer Teller könn'n wir fegen
Doch das ändert nichts, dass die Teller fehlen
Wir reden öfter über Trennung als vom Heiraten
Sag, wie soll ich so in Liebe mit dir einschlafen?
Du bist für diese Worte schon zu blind
Ich denk' an unser ungeborenes Kind und frag' mich

Wir haben alles probiert
Und auch alles riskiert
Doch einer von uns hat schon aufgegeben
Darum kämpfen wir, bis einer seine Maske verliert
Entweder du oder ich, wir haben alles probiert
Und auch alles riskiert
Doch einer von uns hat schon aufgegeben
Darum kämpfen wir, bis einer seine Maske verliert

Nightmares & Fantasies,Devilish Trio,2018,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/devilishtrio/nightmaresfantasies.html,"[Baker:]
I'm smoking bud alot tryin to ease the stress from daily regiments
A man can only stay so strong I try to make the best of it
I'm earning every crumb and cent
Workin till it makes me sick
A cold world we living in but never will it make me quit
So many nightmares they wake me up from deep sleep
Lost in this dead zone I feel alone but I'm at peace
My past demons weighing heavy but I won't retreat
Rip the veil from my eyes I finally see the truth of things
Portrait of a broken dream I pick the pieces up and heal
In my mind I can't be beat this is the strength of human will
Feel the power of your worth and put to bed those false idols
Ain't no need to give your life to bullshit cause time is vital
Do the best with what you can there ain't no reason to give in
All they want is your down fall and you can't let them bitches win
Keep a grin no fear to sin
I must do what I need to live
Taking drastic measures often
I don't wanna be forgived

[Hydra:]
Its just another day
This life we live
Is full of problems
Mane we need a break

We stress too much
So take a pause
And realize you cannot change
The way the world goes around
We all will deal with hatred
Do what you want to simmer down
Don't let depression shape you

Every night I toss and turn
I'll never shake the demons
Its seems like things they just get worse
But still I find a reason
To keep on pushin
Grass is greener
When you choose feed it
I know its hard but deep inside
We all were built with meaning

Obsession holds a sacred place within my thoughts of evil
The beast he follows me in vein
But I'm my brothers keeper
I won't forget these lessons learned
When I confront my weakness
And if I have to go tomorrow
I'm okay with leaving

If it wasn't for music
Then id be shit
Every word that I spit
It comes from the bottomless pit of my crooked soul

When will I die I'll never know
I'm just a cracka from the ville
So I'm gon' keep on takin it slow until
My time is over

Heute Wien, morgen Schweiz, es geht alles so schnell
Eben fünftausend Leute
Die schrei'n und jetzt wieder allein im Hotel
Und sie wollen die Magie gern versteh'n
Ich versteh' sie ja nicht einmal selbst
Unerklärliche Zeiten
Manchmal kann ich's nicht greifen

Wie ein Phantom (brra, ah, ey)
Ein, zwei, drei Schüsse in die Luft
Alle gucken nur hoch (brra, ey-ey, ja)

Boom boom (o-o-o-ooh)

Teach me how to love You
Show me how to trust You
More than with my words or with a song
No, it's not been easy
To live life down on my knees
But with faith I know I'll carry on

There is more to see than with my eyes
But fear sometimes can leave me paralyzed
I realize that I'm not in control
Yet it is well with my soul

The enemy's against me
Arrows all around me
Never knew the fight would last so long
In seasons of depression
I plead for Your protection
Make me right, I'm tired of being wrong

Every time there's hope, it seems to die
And the voices all around me feed that lie
Everything I see tells me to let go
Yet it is well with my soul

It is well (It is well)
With my soul (With my soul)
It is well, it is well with my soul
It is well (It is well)
With my soul (With my soul)
It is well, it is well with my soul

Soul, my soul, woooh, my soul
With my soul, my soul, woooh, it is well with my soul
With my soul, my soul, woooh, my soul, woooh

This fight I'm in is not of flesh and blood
The weapons that I need are in Your love
Lord, don't You ever let me go
You make it well with my soul

It is well (It is well)
With my soul (With my soul)
It is well, it is well with...

Lines, neatly traced and gathered
Like paper thin sewing patterns
Pinned and in their places

Words, blend them into a batter
Words, on a fanciful platter
Served by the maddest of hatters
While we fake our faces

It doesn't matter now

It's all just poison in disguise
Teacups full of candy-coated
Poison in disguise
Teacups full of candy-coated lines

Shapes, oh society loves their shapes
Cookie cutter lives all half baked
Manufactured and sent through
Quality inspection

Two, or maybe three, or four times the fun
Could be had if we'd only come
To the table to feast with
All our imperfections

But it doesn't matter now
It doesn't matter now

Teacups full of candy-coated lines

Everybody fill your cups
Pinkies out and bottoms up
Fake a smile and drink it down

Look me in the eyes
And tell me your right where you wanna be

Then you became a part of me
At that honeymoon phase
Didn't last be a couple days
But I wanted it to stay

Did I mess it up
With my heart of a kid
And my mind opinionated
Didn't know when we'd start
Didn't make it very clear
Just talk, I'm right here

A day becomes a night
Can't tell where to take this to
I'm still happy, but are you
It seems as if you don't see me like you used to

And you were still a part of me
Just glad to see your face
Hadn't seen you for days
All I wanted was to stay

Did I mess it up
With my heart of a kid
And my mind opinionated
Didn't know when we'd start
You didn't make it very clear
Just talk, I'm right here

Did we end it right
I guess we never had a fight
But by now I thought we might
Could we ever give this another try

Don't throw me back in the line
Days turn into seasons

This path is worth the pain

When I want to say hello to one of my good friends
I peek my head out, say wassup, then go back in

I wish I was a turtle (yeah!)
Just doing things that turtles do
Just walkin' slow and eatin' grass
And living for a really long time
It'd be like a dream come true
What did you say?
My shell is eighty percent sound proof
I wish I was a turtle and that's the
God's honest truth, ye-eh-ay

When I want to say hello to one of my good friends
I peek my head out, say what's up, then go back in

Low Hanging Fruit,Heart Attack Man,2019,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/heartattackman/lowhangingfruit.html,"All you can eat low hanging fruit for you and me
We'll be shaded by the branches
And sheltered by the tree
How's it taste?

Don't wanna think or have to form my own beliefs
Can you hold my hand forever?
Make up my mind for me

Eat to our hearts' content
Blissfully ignorant
Plenty for everyone
There's more than enough

I'm helpless and stupid
Pampered, spoon-fed
I'm shallow and lazy
A fucking baby

Wil alleen de chick als ik luister [?], emo

Ik heb m'n money opgenomen als een memo
Ik haal die dingen uit de muur, net FEBO

Te Canto un Son,Alejandro Sanz,2019,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alejandrosanz/tecantounson.html,"Ay niña, a ver
De dónde sacas la gracia
El viento para tu pelo
Y el fuego para tu falda, dime

Tengo un corazón que se parte en dos
La mitad pa' la Havana
Y otra parte allí que se me quedó
De mitad gaditana
Pero es que las personas son las que valen
El corazón se me parte
Mira, esta canción te la canto al aire
Para que tú me la bailes

Cuba en el alma
Y Miami en el corazón
Soy un flamenquito en la Havana
Soy de Cádiz, te canto un son
Pero que mira que

Cuba en el alma
Y Miami en el corazón
Soy un flamenquito en la Havana
Soy de Cádiz, te canto un son

Tengo un corazón que se parte en dos
La mitad pa' la Havana
La otra parte en un alfiler quedó
En el pelo de España
Pero es que yo en Miami tengo una barca
El corazón se me parte
Pero en Cádiz baila la gaditana, arte
El corazón se me parte

Cuba en el alma
Y Miami en el corazón
Soy un flamenquito en la Havana
Soy de Cádiz, te canto un son
Pero que mira que

Cuba en el alma
Y Miami en el corazón
Soy un flamenquito en la Havana
Soy de Cádiz, te canto un son

Soy, pero es que soy de Cádiz yo
Yo te canto un son, corazón
Soy un flamenquito en la Havana
Enamora'o de una cubana
De Madrid te traigo el calor
La caleta me enamoró
Yo te voy a cantar mi canción
Pasando por el Malecón

Vallenato, rock y flamenco
Soy latino gracias a Dios

Kickdown im Mustang GT, ah

Petit Con,Sinik,2020,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sinik/petitcon.html,"Les embrouilles à deux balles, les espoirs, le meilleur et le bleu des condés
Je sais de quoi je parle, j'ai fait tellement d'erreurs, je ne peux les compter
Petit con, petit con, petit con, petit con

Alors comme ça tu vends d'la drogue ? Méchant comme Escobar
Et dans 20 ans tu seras mort ou comme ces gens qui restent au bar
Plus d'école, plus d'entrainement, comme Choupo sur le banc d'touche
On me l'a dit ""ne cherche pas, petit, les murs ont des grandes bouches""
N'oublie pas si tu pensais que tes amis seraient ton ombre
Si le placard les menaçait, les trois-quarts donneraient ton nom
Avant toi on s'est battu, j'ai vu les flammes, l'Essonne en feu
Tu sais vraiment qui sont les hommes quand y a des femmes, des sommes en jeu
Toi, toi qui penses que le cellules sont des endroits ensoleillés
72h de fils de putes, faire de son pull un oreiller
Petit con n'a rien compris, insouciant, la douche en plus, continu de croire que les sons-pri ne sont remplies que d'ours en peluche
Il ne sait pas ce qu'est la drogue, j'ai consommé tellement de merde
Tu ne sais pas ce qu'est la mort, j'ai consolé tellement de mères
Trop de bruit quand la nuit tombe, sous alcool cela aidant
Tu comprendras bien assez tôt quand ton bébé fera ses dents

Les embrouilles à deux balles, les espoirs, le meilleur et le bleu des condés
Je sais de quoi je parle, j'ai fait tellement d'erreurs, je ne peux les compter
Petit con, petit con, petit con, petit con

Peu de femmes sont consentantes, un mari qui vend la came
T'auras jamais de compte en banque, aucun dealer ne prend la carte
Fais des gosses mais n'oublie pas que les erreurs ça rend infirme
Que trois parloirs en une semaine ça fait à peine le temps d'un film
Et si l'alcool c'était de l'eau, alors écoute, c'est triste à dire, on n'a jamais perdu un frère à cause d'un verre de Cristaline
Les victimes ou les gros durs, sache que la mort est transparente
On en a vu des gens trop surs qui s'endormaient à 140
Hypocrite sera ta cause, Paris la nuit, la vie d'fêtard
Manger des pâtes mais sans la sauce, prendre une bouteille à 1000 pétards
Bouton rouge sur un boîtier devant des mères qui portent un deuil
Tu peux rêver mais à moitié, vendeur de drogue ça dort d'un œil

Les embrouilles à deux balles, les espoirs, le meilleur et le bleu des condés
Je sais de quoi je parle, j'ai fait tellement d'erreurs, je ne peux les compter
Petit con, petit con, petit con, petit con

Pas d'argent sur le pécule
Le manque du père, j'ai vécu tout c'que t'as vécu
Si tu savais le temps qu'tu perds
J'vais pas t'faire un exposé, mais chez nous la gâchette parle
Tu seras jamais un mec posé, y a des choses qu'on achète pas
Calibré alors assume, te fais pas prendre comme un mec bête
Si tu tires ça sert à rien d'viser la lune comme Amel Bent
Mets ton casque et n'oublie pas quand toute la ville fera silence
Que la moto était minime et la douleur sera immense
Plus d'amis quand t'es en chien, ça préfère snapper des tainp'
Tu comprendras si t'es en taule que tu dois gratter des timbres
Le cimetière ou le cachot, et ceux qui t'aiment en pâtiront
Quand ce sera chaud, au premier tir, ils partiront

Les embrouilles à deux balles, les espoirs, le meilleur et le bleu des condés
Je sais de quoi je parle, j'ai fait tellement d'erreurs, je ne peux les compter
Petit con, petit con, petit con, petit con

Trazos,SHÉ,2020,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/she/trazos.html,"Nos obcecamos tanto en descubrir la verdad
Que olvidamos que muy pocos quieren que lo hagamos;
Pero la verdad siempre estará ahí la veamos o no
La elijamos o no, nos esperará eternamente

A veces los días son como folios en blanco
Como arena y asfalto
Cada trazo es un camino
Y tienes que saber cual es el tuyo
Vive, solo así podrás interpretarlo
Sal afuera y mira bien el mundo te esta hablando
Escucha el te dará el donde y el cuando
Escoge bien las cartas del mañana y date prisa
Porque el tiempo que pierdas no podrás recuperarlo
Dicen que la vida es la prueba que nos prepara para
Cuando todo acaba comienza realmente todo
Jamás aprenderemos a estar al lado de nadie
Mientras no aprendamos a estar solos
Cuídate del miedo y los errores
Hay pasos que te enseñan y otros que serán cadenas
Arriesga y apuesta todo lo que tengas en tus manos
Solo si de verdad sientes que merecerá la pena

Queda mucho por andar
Aun hay lineas sin destino que tengo que dibujar
Quiero aprender a volar sin temer al suelo
Quiero aprender a querer sin que duela luego

Todavía queda mucho por hacer
Aún hay miles de caminos que tengo que recorrer
Quiero aprender a saltar sin sentir el miedo
Quiero que seamos uno, cada que vez que nos miremos

Tantos caminos para andar, y yo sentado
Todos mirando hacia el futuro y yo el pasado
La suerte es quien decide, a menudo tira sus dados
Y yo ni sé el numero que me ha tocado
Me limito a observar en silencio las cosas
Como el cielo, las montañas, la gente, el ruido
Y es que a veces las preguntas son como un laberinto
Cuanto mas avanzas, a la vez mas confundido
La respuesta es caprichosa
Suele vivir camuflada
Puede estar en la mirada de cualquier persona
En la letra de canciones que todavía no escuchaste
O en aquel consejo ajeno que tomaste a broma
Puede ser ese viaje que jamás hiciste
O esos labios que por miedo ya no besaste
Puede estar en el perdón de alguien a quien heriste
O en el trabajo que no tienes pero que siempre soñaste

Queda mucho por andar
Aun hay lineas sin destino que tengo que dibujar
Quiero aprender a volar sin temer al suelo
Quiero aprender a querer sin que duela luego

Todavía queda mucho por hacer
Aún hay miles de caminos que tengo que recorrer
Quiero aprender a saltar sin sentir el miedo
Quiero que seamos uno, cada que vez que nos miremos

A veces las noches son como cuadros de infarto
Como un océano sin barcos
Como el reflejo que muestra el agua de un charco
Donde me busco a diario pero no hay ni rastro
No cabe mi recuerdo dentro de ese frasco
Del amor al olvido tan solo hay un chasco
Dicen que hay tiempo para todo, pero no hasta cuando
Si el destino esta escrito, el mío se esta borrando
Tal vez no llegan las preguntas que le estoy lanzando
O tal vez si, pero el cabrón me las esta ignorando
O quizá quiere que me de de frente con ese algo
Para que sea yo quien descubra lo que esta pasando
Quizá no hay nada tras la puerta que estoy llamando
Quizá mañana es un vació y yo quiero llenarlo
Mientras el sol salga de nuevo seguiré buscando
Sé que el destino tiene un precio y la pregunta es: ¿Cuánto?

""Cuando la verdad ofende, nosotros mentimos y mentimos
Hasta que olvidamos que la verdad sigue ahí
Y aun así, sigue ahí
Cada mentira que decimos supone una deuda a la verdad
Tarde o temprano esa deuda se paga
A la verdad no le importa lo que necesitamos
No le importan los gobiernos
Ni las ideologías, ni las religiones
Antes temía el precio de la verdad
Ahora solo me pregunto:
¿Cuál es el precio de la mentira?""

There was nowhere left to walk

Only one way is clear
It's the only light that shines
Pointing back through the years
Where do we go from here?

Dear Dead End
You became my closest friend
I followed you down so far beyond
The places I'd already gone
Till we came to a stop
It looks a lot like my old block

Where do we go from here?
Here where the streets decline
Only one way is clear
It's the only light that shines
Pointing back through the years
Tell me, where do we go from here?

You turn
You turn
Turn
You turn turn turn

Dear dead end, I met your view
With the only feet I knew
Thanks for showing me the way
First, for leading me astray
How we stop and how we start
How we all get torn apart

Where do we go from here?
Here where the streets decline
Only the past is clear
It's the only light that shines
Pointing back through the years
Tell me, where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
I gotta leave you here

That year
That fall

Falling snowflakes

You decoded
The firewalls
Between all living beings

You saw the beauty
Shining
You saved that feeling

A written down epiphany
Unfolding origami

T'es pas le plus fou, y a toujours plus fou

Love on me in the daytime
Like you do at bedtime
So they can all know

(Rudeboyz)
Dice

Mucha gatica suelta y mucho perro sato
Quinientos mil en la muñeca y veinte en los zapatos
Un par de cosas en el sistema para el arrebato
Estamos en los Emiratos

Muévelo, ese pum pum, ya muévelo
A mi cuerpo pégalo
Así como me gusta a mí
Muévelo, ese pum pum, ya muévelo
A mi cuerpo pégalo
Así como me gusta a mí

Muévelo, ese pum pum, ya muévelo
A mi cuerpo pégalo
Así como me gusta a mí
Muévelo, ese pum pum, ya muévelo
A mi cuerpo pégalo
Así como me gusta a mí

Ya me siento como un jeque árabe
Tanta grasa, me resbalé
Bebé, llegó tu jarabe, yeah
A una esquina solita me la llevé
De la mano yo la agarré
Y en lo oscuro la perreé

De su boca el humo, me lo pasó
Y por su puesto, no me molestó
De lo contrario, todo me encantó
Estaba con ropa haciéndome el amor
Sus amiguitas nos vieron
Pero nunca se escondieron
Llamé a mi pana, llamé a mi parcero
Y rapidito se unieron

Al perreo-reo y por lo que veo
Está más dura que Cardi B dándole al twerkeo
Y por lo que veo, te llevaste el trofeo
Vamo' ahí pa' mi cama, ven, yo te lo entrego

Al perreo-reo y por lo que veo
Está más dura que Cardi B dándole al twerkeo
Y por lo que veo, te llevaste el trofeo
Vamo' ahí pa' mi cama, ven, yo te lo entrego

Muévelo, ese pum pum, ya muévelo
A mi cuerpo pégalo
Así como me gusta a mí
Muévelo, ese pum pum, ya muévelo
A mi cuerpo pégalo
Así como me gusta a mí

Muévelo, ese pum pum, ya muévelo
A mi cuerpo pégalo
Así como me gusta a mí
Muévelo, ese pum pum, ya muévelo
A mi cuerpo pégalo
Así como me gusta a mí

(Muévelo, ese pum pum, ya muévelo)
(A mi cuerpo pégalo)
(Así como me gusta a mí)
Muévelo, ese pum pum, ya muévelo
A mi cuerpo pégalo
Así como me

Burnin' Train,Bruce Springsteen,2020,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brucespringsteen/burnintrain.html,"Zero's my number, time is my hunter
I wanted you to heal me but instead you set me on fire
We were out over the borders, I washed you in holy water
We whispered our black prayers and rose up in flames

Take me on your burnin' train
Take me on your burnin' train

White sun burnin', black wings beatin'
I ran my fingers 'cross the hollow of your stomach as you lay breathing
With our shared faith
Rising dark and decayed
Take me and shake me from this mortal cage

Take me on your burnin' train
Take me on your burnin' train

Something's shining in the light 'neath your breast
The thick smell of you on my chest

On your bed of thorns, I brought you shining gifts
Wiped the sweat from your brow and I touched your lips
Sheets stained with sweat, outside the endless rain
Darlin', I'm blessed in your blood and marked by Cain

Take me on your burnin' train
Take me on your burnin' train
Take me on your burnin' train

Auf Dein Nacken,Nazar,2020,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nazar/aufdeinnacken.html,"Chivas trinken und ein Cheeseburger, 'nen dreifachen
Linien ziehen und Lieder singen wie an Weihnachten
Sonne sehen, nie wieder mich warm einpacken
Doch niemals selber bezahlen, alles auf dein' Nacken

Ay, ruf deinen Bodyguard und er kriegt vor dir Bretter wie Tony Hawk
Immer auf der Jagd, was für Kaufvertrag? Multimillionär à la Tony Stark
Was jucken mich deine Verkaufszahlen?
Im meisten Fall müsste man draufzahlen
Was ich mit dir mache, bist du frech, ist wie Mandala, Dicker, das kannst du dir ausmahlen
Hundert Riesen könnt ich verdienen heut, wenn ich wollte
Doch genieße den Cuba Libre auf den Malediven
Liege in der Sonne, lasse mich massieren von 'ner Filipina
Optisch ähnlich Asa Akira
""Ja, die Chaya, sie ist andere Liga"", sagt der kleine Mann im Burj Khalifa
Ich will

Chivas trinken und ein Cheeseburger, 'nen dreifachen (Mh)
Linien ziehen und Lieder singen wie an Weihnachten (Ja)
Sonne sehen, nie wieder mich warm einpacken (Nein-nein)
Doch niemals selber bezahlen, alles auf dein' Nacken (Rrra)

Chivas trinken und ein Cheeseburger, 'nen dreifachen (Ja-ja)
Linien ziehen und Lieder singen wie an Weihnachten (Ah-ah)
Sonne sehen, nie wieder mich warm einpacken (Nein-nein)
Doch niemals selber bezahlen, alles auf dein' Nacken (No-no)

Meine Karre ist Minimum Daimler
Schiebe Filme wie William Wyler
N-A-Z ist der Star auf der Leinwand
Du bist maximal Fucker in Thailand
Fokussiert so wie Roger Federer
Konzentriert so wie Conor McGregor
Du bist kein Stecher, dein Tattoo ist Henna
Dein Kontostand gleich meiner Maison Margiela
Lauf-Ikone in der Jogginghose so wie Usain Bolt
Mehr Probleme, more money, Krone meiner neuen Rolex zeigt mein' Erfolg
Lad Patronen in die Pistole, ja, meine Bose läuft auf 100 Volt
Meine Prognose: Investiere fünfzig, mach hundertsechzig, geh Streaming-Gold
Ich will

Chivas trinken und ein Cheeseburger, 'nen dreifachen (Mh)
Linien ziehen und Lieder singen wie an Weihnachten (Ja)
Sonne sehen, nie wieder mich warm einpacken (Nein-nein)
Doch niemals selber bezahlen, alles auf dein' Nacken (Common-common)

Chivas trinken und ein Cheeseburger, 'nen dreifachen (Ja-ja)
Linien ziehen und Lieder singen wie an Weihnachten (Ah-ah)
Sonne sehen, nie wieder mich warm einpacken (Nein-nein)
Doch niemals selber bezahlen, alles auf dein' Nacken (Ja-ja)

Nicht auf mein' Nacken (Nein)
Nicht auf sein' Nacken
Niemals selber bezahlen, alles auf dein' Nacken
Nicht auf mein' Nacken (Nein)
Nicht auf sein' Nacken (Nein-nein)
Niemals selber bezahlen, alles auf dein' Nacken

They janky, they clones
C'mon, I'm iced cold, bitch
Frankie carbone
Rallying up the troops
Homie was wallin of the juice
I had to kick him in his ass
I had $2, 000 boots
Don't be a victim on the ave
Your older homie was the proof
I'm from an era buddle up niggas
Would rob you for your goose
Hol' up, you was never a star
You carried kittles, nigga
You from a lineage of little niggas
You in the middle
Sorta like second fiddle
Trying to belittle niggas
You ever questioned how you living, nigga
Game changer, underdogs taking the lead
Boss nigga but my purpose bigger than me
Pick of the litter
Pick up the tree for a fee
Hit the bakery and holla at chee
Godspeed

I look like a boss
I feel like a boss
I smell like a boss
I taste like a boss

I pop shit bottles and tags
I promise you that

Ghost in the face, hard in the pain, nauseous
Close to the bank, fall for the fake conscience
Suicide doors on the matte-black Porsches
All black angel with a halo, with a sword in

Take money, money

Play money, money
Fake money, money

Take money, money
They money, money

Play money, money
Fake money, money

Stüssy SB dunks, I'm missing a school lunch
A body will turn cold in that Icecream zip-up
Ditch class to kiss on a twin sister
Pish-posh, I'm probably pushing a Civic
Fist balled, I promise I ain't with it
My partner got a Glizzy, please don't make him get it
Please don't make a move, my team will make the news
I keen on breaking rules, my jeans hold.22's
I dreamed at 16 of being on Star Trek
Niggas is haters, I'm ducking deals from the majors
Icecream sneakers, I double-knot my laces
All gold Blackberry, hard to get in touch
Solid gold fronts, tooth fairy fall in love
Angel battle on the hood, hood, stand up
Never been no type of shook, Euro stop the bluff
Put your hands up if you really with the jump
Get your body dropped off at your momma's crib, love

Take money, money

Play money, money
Fake money, money

Play money, money

Watch your mouth when you speak to me
I'm the new black history
Watch your back when you close to me
I keep an all-glass rosary
Hopped out in an all white NSX
With my eyes on low, hickey on my neck
With a ""fuck you"" face, porcelain skin
My jaws on switchblade, 6'1"", mixed
The love of your life
Love for the night
I'm a ghost in the wind
I'm a part-time friend

I don't keep score, I keep scoring
I don't keep score, I keep scoring
I don't keep score, I keep scoring
I don't keep score, I keep scoring
I don't keep score, I keep scoring

Get outta here, you're bullshit
And I could complain but I don't
You want me too but I won't

I'm moving to Russia, the vodka, the caviar
The suicidal novelists and red stars
Come along, drop your things but I know you won't

Cause you stay, stay
Break my heart every single day
Will you stay, stay
Break my heart every single day

I'm stuck where you stay, so I play
And you play too so I'm upset
Can she go my way, but she don't
I want her to but she won't

I'm moving to Russia, the vodka, the caviar
The suicidal novelists and red stars
Come along, drop your things but I know you won't

Will you stay, stay
Break my heart every single day
Will you stay, stay
Break my heart every single day

The way that you killed me that night
Shot a hole in my heart, some part of me died

Two bodies on a bed, jack knife
One's a lover, the other's my wife
Something about you came alive
From the sing of your song to the ring of your lies

Shake she's coming
Shake she's coming
Shake she's coming

Freedom lover
Shakes an earthquake of such magnitude
Every pleasure denied
Wakes the devil inside

We've stopped breathing
Un-cock your shotgun
Way past victim

Strangers,Dayglow,2021,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dayglow/strangers.html,"I've been on my own these days
Trying to figure out the pace
When I don't even know the place, I'm going to
It's gotten to the point one time
I didn't recognize myself
I thought that I was someone else beside you

So where do I go
When I don't even know where I am right now?
And what am I to believe
When things keep getting stranger?
Oh, I know so many strangers

And I tried to organize my fears,
But they didn't change at all
And now they live across the hall from each other
And I made a few friends last week,
And thought I fell in love again
But I'm already in Los Angeles
And they both love one another

So, what do I do
When everything feels new,
But all I want is to feel my age?
And what am I to say
When you feel like a stranger?
Oh, I know so many strangers
And strangers and strangers
I know so many strangers
And strangers and strangers
And everything is stranger
And stranger and stranger
And stranger and stranger
And stranger
